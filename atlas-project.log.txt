15.12.18 12:34:36<editable-dog>well, the way im looking at our reasoner is that its a thingy that does a resolution procedure for a subset of FOL
15.12.18 12:35:10<editable-dog>we apparently have rules with existentials, and we have binary relations or something
15.12.18 12:35:32<editable-dog>we apparently dont have complex terms, but that doesnt seem to be a problem
15.12.18 12:36:25<editable-dog>so we have this system that has a correspondence to fol, which i suppose gives us some guarantees or something
15.12.18 12:37:08<editable-dog>we happen to use this rdf thing for input and output and maybe inbetween
15.12.18 12:37:34<editable-dog>but as you note, rdf is ill-defined all around
15.12.18 12:38:06<editable-dog>pecularities of how we interpret some rdf input are up to us, and how we interface with other reasoners is up to us and them
15.12.18 12:38:34<editable-dog>rdf doesnt give us any theoretic foundation
15.12.18 12:40:30<editable-dog>i wanna look more into how we can do lc in pyco
15.12.18 12:40:46<editable-dog>and how we can type our rules
15.12.18 15:04:53<stoopkid> hrm
15.12.18 15:05:33<stoopkid> to do proper lc & typing we would need predvars (or some kind of guarded predvar via findall)
15.12.18 15:20:17<stoopkid> we can maybe do pure combinatory logic and compile lambdas down to that
15.12.18 15:39:40<editable-dog>ok, so i'll add findall

17.12.18 14:10:07<editable-dog>so, have you given up on autonomic?
17.12.18 14:19:54<stoopkid> hrm, at least on the type-theory/RDF based nomic block-chain aspect of it
17.12.18 14:21:19<editable-dog>lol, whats left?
17.12.18 14:21:59<stoopkid> well i mean we still have inferencer stuff we built that could be used in other contexts
17.12.18 14:29:55<editable-dog>ok
17.12.18 14:30:02<editable-dog>sucks, tho
17.12.18 14:30:46<editable-dog>then i guess ill try to go back to prolog for parsing/language building
17.12.18 14:33:39<editable-dog>idk
17.12.18 16:17:55<stoopkid> yea idk i'm still trying to figure some things out
17.12.18 16:18:42<stoopkid> i was sort of banking on the idea that after we figured out HMC's scheme for termination, i guess the parsimonious back-chaining thing hypothetically, then the picture would just start to come together, but
17.12.18 16:20:06<stoopkid> idk i'm still not seeing the picture, and on further analysis i'm not even sure i have the parsimonious back-chaining thing exactly right anyway
17.12.18 16:20:43<stoopkid> i think there's a lot of edge-cases i'm not accounting for that just don't come up in the forward-chaining version and weren't accounted for in that algorithm
17.12.18 16:21:23<stoopkid> but even if i did have it exactly right i don't really understand exactly how to relate it to the type theory rules
17.12.18 16:21:51<stoopkid> i'm not even sure how we get predvars out of findall
17.12.18 16:22:27<stoopkid> or rather, i don't get what's special about having predvars in findall but not just having regular predvars
17.12.18 16:23:06<stoopkid> i can tell that HMC intended to have access to predvars essentially be guarded by findall, but i can't tell exactly what he had in mind for this
17.12.18 16:24:37<stoopkid> or why he found it to be necessary
17.12.18 16:25:15<stoopkid> just really not sure what he has for a significant portion of it at all
17.12.18 16:25:23<stoopkid> has in mind*
17.12.18 16:27:31<stoopkid> and i'm not sure how to extract it out of him either
17.12.18 16:28:30<stoopkid> i can see that none of the constraints i'm failing to satisfy so far really have anything to do with representing or using the type theory as a programming language, or verification framework, or inferencing system or even as a distributed version of any of that
17.12.18 16:29:40<stoopkid> ex. agda is a programming lang, verification framework, and inferencing system, and could have easily been made a distributed version of that
17.12.18 16:29:48<stoopkid> but it's quite obviously not working under the same constraints as HMC is
17.12.18 16:30:17<stoopkid> i can easily set up some queries that show that Agda's inferencing is generally non-terminating it just cuts it off after some max-depth
17.12.18 16:30:44<stoopkid> cause, who cares right
17.12.18 16:31:05<stoopkid> you could even just let it run forever it's not gonna hurt anything
17.12.18 16:31:52<stoopkid> their type-checking is more of an ad-hoc thing kinda like what we did following the simpler-easier tutorial, just a more advanced version of that
17.12.18 16:33:33<stoopkid> but otoh, they aren't running a nomic on a block-chain and cramming it into as minimal of semantic web standards as they can
17.12.18 16:36:55<stoopkid> and i'd say i'm really not confident enough at this stage that i know how to cram it down into those constraints myself
17.12.18 16:37:12<stoopkid> i'm still having trouble even formulating what are the right questions to even ask about it
17.12.18 16:39:55<stoopkid> and i feel like that would just be getting way ahead of myself cause i'm still trying to even demo the basic features that my ideas for next-gen apps are all predicated on
17.12.18 16:42:30<stoopkid> and then from another direction, you've come up a method for termination that's... idk how to describe it
17.12.18 16:43:00<stoopkid> "american spent $10 million on a pen that could write in 0 gravity and the czech used a pencil"
17.12.18 16:44:04<editable-dog>and then the graphite got into all their delicate equipment and the space station exploded
17.12.18 16:45:35<stoopkid> yea the introduction of the temporal element breaks the methods of analysis i've used on the other systems
17.12.18 16:46:09<stoopkid> so i'm still wondering whether or not it matters
17.12.18 16:46:18<editable-dog>its not really temporal, or at least you can look at it as structural i think
17.12.18 16:48:09<editable-dog>but it seems that i can already tell by now, that even if i have a guarantee for eventual termination, it seems its just a nicety, because in practice, even simple kb+query can run for a long long time
17.12.18 16:49:09<editable-dog>and then the findall vs predvars thing...idk either
17.12.18 16:50:38<editable-dog>but the way i feel about both is ... alright, we have something, we've got to build more stuff, put it to use, we have the questions, we kinda understand the tradeoffs and answers..
17.12.18 16:51:18<editable-dog>so we just need to put the system to use so we can get definive answers
17.12.18 16:51:30<editable-dog>so, i dont feel like these are roadblocks
17.12.18 16:52:48<stoopkid> with the termination there's reasons for "total functional", but i can't tell how it matters except for *above* the type theory layer already, and there's proof-checking.. proof-checking should be terminating (lot's of results about how logics even work at all simply just don't even apply if proof-checking isn't terminating) but... you don't even want this to simply be terminating you want it to be fast like basically
                 <stoopkid> linear in the size of the proof
17.12.18 16:54:02<stoopkid> but then, proof-checking in type theories isn't terminating/efficient because of how the inferencing system works, it's terminating/efficient because of the specific set of rules that are given in an inferencing system that has all the potential to infloop on other rulesets
17.12.18 16:54:13<stoopkid> or even the same ruleset with a different kind of query than proof-checking
17.12.18 16:55:36<stoopkid> it only terminates because the rules that describe the proof-checking are already structurally recursive
17.12.18 16:58:22<stoopkid> which comes to another thing i still just don't really understand about HMC's plans: what is all this other stuff we're doing "outside" of the type theory
17.12.18 16:58:56<stoopkid> and i think my failure to grasp that is part of why i can't figure out how that all that extra stuff is supposed to work
17.12.18 16:59:29<editable-dog>the only thing i understand wrt typechecking and termination checking is the thing with deriving a contradiction from having a recursive function without a base case, and it doesnt seem to matter if we limit such a function with a "maximum depth counter" or with some variety of ep check
17.12.18 16:59:55<editable-dog>like what?
17.12.18 17:00:54<stoopkid> well like all these considerations about termination of arbitrary rulesets below the type-theory layer, the open-phase stuff, etc...
17.12.18 17:03:58<stoopkid> the thing with the termination checking thing wrt deriving a contradiction from like x = 1 + x : Nat, that only applies above the type theory layer
17.12.18 17:04:45<stoopkid> at the inferencing layer, it legitimately doesn't matter, as far as the type theory is concerned
17.12.18 17:06:26<stoopkid> i.e. it's the difference between "letting your proof search run for a while or not" and "having a proof that a finite thing is infinite"
17.12.18 17:07:20<editable-dog>mm
17.12.18 17:08:06<stoopkid> like take the  type theory rule {pair(a,b) : A ^ B} <= (a : A . b : B}
17.12.18 17:09:13<stoopkid> when you provide both the term, and the type, and type-check, it's structurally recursive
17.12.18 17:09:56<stoopkid> it might be able to infloop if you leave one or the other variable, or both, but if you provide both you just have some data that you're structurally recursing on
17.12.18 17:10:29<stoopkid> the only place that there's any kind of divergence from this is when you type-check dependent types
17.12.18 17:10:43<stoopkid> i.e. you run some function during type-checking
17.12.18 17:12:20<stoopkid> but a) it's always only a function that was already known terminating from being previously type-checked, and b) i've shown that you can actually describe the type theory in a way that functions actually don't run during type-checking (except for just a single step) and it would be equivalent and structurally recursive
17.12.18 17:13:25<stoopkid> (it just forces the reduction steps to be explicit in the proof)
17.12.18 17:15:51<stoopkid> so, query "?x : Nat"... there's no reason except for human time-constraints that this shouldn't return all infinitely many Nats right?
17.12.18 17:17:00<editable-dog>yea..
17.12.18 17:18:10<stoopkid> but "suc (suc 0) : Nat" will check "suc 0 : Nat" which will check "0 : Nat" and then it's done, just by the structure of the rules
17.12.18 17:20:01<stoopkid> so that's what i mean that i don't understand what constraints are requiring us to have termination of the query "?x : Nat" except for "whenever the human user decided it should stop"
17.12.18 17:20:09<stoopkid> "if ever"
17.12.18 17:20:38<stoopkid> it's not the type theory
17.12.18 17:23:26<stoopkid> non-termination of the inferencing wouldn't even let you construct the terms like x = 1 + x : Nat in the type-theory
17.12.18 17:23:31<stoopkid> because it wouldn't type-check
17.12.18 17:24:43<stoopkid> agda's termination-check here is just kind of a weird way of saying you didn't make valid usage of the elimination rule for Nat
17.12.18 17:25:51<stoopkid> like, they present it like you're writing a generally recursive function like in haskell, and then it gets "checked for termination"
17.12.18 17:27:29<stoopkid> but if you look at the actual elimination rule for Nat in natural deduction, termination check is "built-in", you only had the option to write a proof in terms of a specific form of structural induction in the first place
17.12.18 17:29:55<editable-dog>hmm
17.12.18 17:31:32<editable-dog>well, the typecheck is trying to build the proof, right?
17.12.18 17:32:01<stoopkid> no it's just checking the proof
17.12.18 17:32:49<stoopkid> "suc (suc 0) : Nat" as opposed to "?x : Nat"
17.12.18 17:34:21<stoopkid> cause "suc (suc 0)" encodes the rule-applications that were applied in a particular proof of Nat, so the inferencing is basically just tracing this backwards: "suc (suc 0) : Nat" because "suc 0 : Nat" because "0 : Nat"
17.12.18 17:37:06<stoopkid> so it's just checking that a proof-tree is actually a proof-tree instead of trying to find the proof-tree in the first place
17.12.18 17:37:51<editable-dog>ah,ok
17.12.18 17:41:53<stoopkid> so the only way you really break it is if the queries with no variables like "suc (suc 0) : Nat" can either a) not terminate or b) be wrong
17.12.18 17:43:20<stoopkid> anything with a variable in it (not including lambda variables, cause those are actually just objects in the proofs), it can't really have any bearing on the type theory itself, because only the judgements of the form "this object has this type" are considered to be the "facts" of the system
17.12.18 17:46:01<stoopkid> and these are always terminating, logical, well-behaved... so all of our considerations here wrt termination of arbitrary queries on arbitrary rule-sets are completely entirely independent of anything type theory really says about it
17.12.18 17:46:18<editable-dog>cool
17.12.18 17:46:22<stoopkid> unless we had some kind of interpretation that this was already supposed to "be" the type theory in the first place
17.12.18 17:46:54<stoopkid> but if that's the case it's just another case of "i really don't get the plan"
17.12.18 17:51:16<stoopkid> now with your implementation idk what to make of it cause on the one hand i don't see anything wrong with it, but then on the other hand i don't see how it would fit into HMC's vision
17.12.18 17:53:18<editable-dog>well, as far as im concerned, when i have a grammar encoded as rules, and i want to use them to both parse and generate with, then if i had no ep check, then i'd need to tread a depth parameter through all the rules. With ep check in place, i only need that parameter to do meaningful generation. But all in all it doesnt matter
17.12.18 17:54:52<editable-dog>whats the problem with it fitting? We've shown that we need existentials, and its trivial to see that the ep rules need to be extended to account for them
17.12.18 17:55:25<editable-dog>and my scheme fits the bill, whats the vision?
17.12.18 17:56:54<stoopkid> well, that's part of the problem, i don't really know
17.12.18 17:57:09<stoopkid> but whatever it is it seems to be extremely specific
17.12.18 17:59:21<editable-dog>well, he keeps being wrong in all the extreme specifics
17.12.18 18:02:34<stoopkid> this is true but if we change it up from "we're doing HMC's plan for autonomic" then we might as well just be doing our own thing at which point i'm reconsidering all kinds of things including whether to even be building a nomic block-chain in the first place, whether to even consider entirely arbitrary rule-sets (or rather, whether to concern myself with the termination or any other property of general inferencing
                 <stoopkid> over them), etc..
17.12.18 18:04:58<stoopkid> if i were to design a nomic block-chain myself it would only use proof-checking as a fundamental operation, not proof-search, and would specifically leave proof-search an open-ended between-block operation
17.12.18 18:06:02<stoopkid> the rules up to a certain block simply describe the type of the next block and then you're just type-checking
17.12.18 18:06:55<stoopkid> maybe i'd have a design flaw because i didn't worry enough about homoiconicity but w/e
17.12.18 18:07:37<editable-dog>yea i like the homoiconicity part
17.12.18 18:09:05<editable-dog>i dont have a good idea about proof-search vs proof-checking there, but..
17.12.18 18:09:32<editable-dog>whoever wants to play a nomic on a blockchain can experiment with that
17.12.18 18:10:00<editable-dog>like, its total nonsense that there'd only be one chance to get tau right
17.12.18 18:10:29<editable-dog>you imagine we release it and everyone jumps onto it?
17.12.18 18:10:38<editable-dog>nobody gives a fuck
17.12.18 18:12:07<editable-dog>but i can tell you've been thinking about this long enough to be able to design such a system
17.12.18 18:15:12<editable-dog>i'll be happy to discuss things back and forth with hmc, but he doesnt seem able/willing to even get back to conversations about these details
17.12.18 18:16:46<editable-dog>like, nilli was the only one able to try to secure some funding for a bit, and before moving on, she said this will never get done until we make it ours and do it our own way
17.12.18 18:19:38<stoopkid> i mean yea i'd keep working on whatever HMC keeps explaining but he doesn't seem to be explaining anything or even responding to any of my technical q's so idk
17.12.18 18:21:33<editable-dog>i need to know if youre still interested enough that if i add findall, we can try to tackle the typing of rules
17.12.18 18:22:26<editable-dog>i suspect its related to reasoning over graphs vs reasoning over the default graph, so ill probably have to ask hmc to explain this bit to me
17.12.18 18:23:08<stoopkid> hrm...
17.12.18 18:24:26<editable-dog>then i can add some general syscall capability, and that might just be almost enough to play a nomic even? idk
17.12.18 18:24:38<stoopkid> i'm still interested but if we were to be doing it our own way i would probably do it a different way
17.12.18 18:27:23<stoopkid> i would probably revert to something explicitly non-terminating in proof-search, add predvars, and simulate the natural deduction rules for type theory directly that way
17.12.18 18:31:49<stoopkid> and then adjust from there as necessary/desired
17.12.18 18:34:49<stoopkid> afaict there wouldn't really need to be any adjustments from that in order to host a nomic
17.12.18 18:36:12<editable-dog>i think i can add predvars to pyco without too much changes, and it definitely will have the advantage, at least for us, over findall, in having at least seemingly obvious semantics, and if it makes the typing rules cleaner, its a no brainer
17.12.18 18:36:37<editable-dog>as on removing the ep check, that one is trivial
17.12.18 18:37:47<editable-dog>although im not sure i see any advantage in that, because i think our ep check already only cuts things that would otherwise really just loop forever until running out of memory
17.12.18 18:42:42<stoopkid> well, above the type theory layer, where the nomic will play out, the only real "rules" are the type theory rules and the only move is providing a proof, so everything's just already terminating and in time linear in the size of the proof (including in the time-dimension if you're employing the syntactic sugar of "running functions during type-checking")
17.12.18 18:44:33<stoopkid> so the only time ep-check should matter is in what other kinds of inferencing you do "around" the nomic, in between block-checking (proof-checking) operations
17.12.18 18:46:58<stoopkid> and i basically want to leave that entirely open-ended, like you could hypothetically try to use a neural net to try to come up with the next block, all that will matter is that whatever your search process generated, no matter what method was employed, will only be accepted if it successfully passes the deterministic proof-checking according to the type theory rules
17.12.18 18:48:11<stoopkid> and we can ofc have some "sane" defaults
17.12.18 18:48:52<stoopkid> but i mean, if somebody hypothetically wants to just have their inferencer run in trivial loops...
17.12.18 18:49:35<stoopkid> ok they're not the one who finds the next block, too bad, no hash-cash for them
17.12.18 18:51:55<stoopkid> i mean, bitcoin doesn't tell you how to run your mining rig
17.12.18 18:53:07<editable-dog>yeah, makes sense from that perspective
17.12.18 18:54:40<stoopkid> from what i can tell the thing that this cuts out from HMC's plans is basically the whole open-phase thing
17.12.18 18:56:04<stoopkid> from what i can tell that was basically just supposed to be a default environment to deliver untyped turing-complete applications into, to run in parallel to the normal "basically just pure math proof-checking of the block-chain"
17.12.18 18:57:05<stoopkid> so in bitcoin, you've got wallets, mining rigs, etc...
17.12.18 18:59:57<stoopkid> but, i don't see why we need this, i don't even necessarily see that it offers any particular convenience
17.12.18 19:01:40<editable-dog>its definitely something to be left out for now
17.12.18 19:03:38<stoopkid> ideally what would eventually accumulate on the chain would be solid math proofs of how to actually compile those kinds of "open-phase" applications down to the bare metal of whatever machine you're working on, and then you would just run that directly anyway
17.12.18 19:05:30<stoopkid> there's maybe a couple issues that would come up with the universe-hierarchy and the kind of self-referential stuff you start doing with having a self-modifying rule-set, but... i think we can cross that bridge when we come to it
17.12.18 19:10:11<stoopkid> i mean, i think there's still some potentially non-trivial considerations we've yet to take into account but i think we probably need to see what happens with a default vanilla implementation of dependent type theory with no particular constraints on the open-phase stuff

18.12.18 14:37:01<stoopkid> yea,  or (n : Nat) -> IsEven n

26.12.18 08:29:05<stoopkid> well, mostly correct anyway
26.12.18 08:29:48<stoopkid> you can simulate functional programming in logic programming and vice versa

25.01.19 12:45:56<stoopkid> man, business is hard
25.01.19 12:46:08<stoopkid> how's your job situation coming along?
25.01.19 12:47:46<stoopkid> i realized my desire to do freelance is futile if i'm only studying the tech cause idk shit about business, marketing or professional networking
25.01.19 12:51:38<stoopkid> so i've been studying that a lot more recently, but it kinda sucks, for me it's one of those things where after studying it you've got better perspective but... only enough perspective to realize how far behind on it you really are
25.01.19 12:53:18<stoopkid> now i find myself focused on things i never even thought i'd ever be studying like.. "personal branding" and "writing effective sales copy"
25.01.19 12:57:08<stoopkid> it's kind of interesting actually cause after studying this stuff, i feel like i'm even further from being able to start successfully freelancing than i originally thought, but i'm finding that the business principles actually apply directly to a lot of the problems i have just on the pure tech side (or at least, my time-management and planning abilities relative to the pure tech)
25.01.19 12:58:30<stoopkid> ex. "personal branding" is just my decisions about what i want to work on and my ability to clearly convey that
25.01.19 13:00:16<stoopkid> "writing effective sales copy" just translates to my ability to clearly express the motivations behind the things i want to work on
25.01.19 13:02:07<stoopkid> analyzing where i fail at these things leads me to find a whole bunch of "unnecessary", "overkill", "not clearly defined" etc.. things i've been trying, which seemed motivated to me from pure tech goals but which are kind of diversions from my actual life goals
25.01.19 13:03:35<stoopkid> so i'm finding the business stuff to be the study of how to connect my actual work to my actual life goals, which when phrased like that it's like... wtf why haven't i been doing that the whole time
25.01.19 13:06:48<stoopkid> but ofc i can point to at least several reasons; first and foremost being that i've had a general disdain for all this stuff like personal branding etc.. that just seems like "business fluff" from a pure tech perspective
25.01.19 13:08:51<stoopkid> secondly, that disdain is actively reinforced by the "pure techie" community, especially in the hardcore open-source and academic communities
25.01.19 13:10:12<stoopkid> thirdly, i prioritize pure tech goals over my own life goals, partly because they're just genuinely more intriguing to me than the mundane stuff of "taking care of myself", and also easier than "figuring out how to solve my actual problems"
25.01.19 13:13:27<stoopkid> so from that perspective, no wonder i've never been able to push myself into any kind of business-wise success for myself: i actively disdain and avoid everything that could help me do that
25.01.19 13:17:14<stoopkid> so i'm realizing now: the brand is literally 100% of everything
25.01.19 13:19:18<stoopkid> the brand is equivalent to the sum-total of the perceptions of the purpose and reliability of everything under that brand. without branding, the work is effectively a non-object
25.01.19 13:23:37<stoopkid> and it's not just other peoples' perceptions of what they're buying from us, it's how we've self-defined our *own* perceptions of what we're even working on, when & how we're working on it, and why
25.01.19 13:27:04<stoopkid> luckily, what i've found as i've been studying all this, is that all the actual "fluff" is actually generally regarded as ridiculous by business analysts, being "fluff" at best and actually damaging to the business at worst
25.01.19 13:29:30<stoopkid> ex. buying followers on social media to appear more successful than you actually are to get people to start following because they think you're already successful
25.01.19 13:30:22<stoopkid> seems like every analyst from forbes agrees that if somebody finds themselves doing something like that, then they should seriously re-evaluate their business
25.01.19 13:32:07<stoopkid> iow: the more "tricks" are involved in a marketing strategy, the poorer the long-term outlook of the business
25.01.19 13:33:26<stoopkid> seems obv. but to somebody like me with no ounce of business sense i have to actually hear that from an expert otherwise i start worrying like "do i need to be doing all these tricks and fluff that it sounds like all the marketing folks do? jeez i hope not but where do i start"
25.01.19 13:34:44<stoopkid> apparently the answer is: branding, branding, branding and more branding
25.01.19 13:38:40<stoopkid> apparently the main goal is: maximum speed that somebody can get an accurate idea of every aspect of what you can/do provide
25.01.19 13:40:28<stoopkid> and then long-term commitment to developing under that same brand
25.01.19 13:42:28<stoopkid> then general gist i'm getting is: you don't even have any tech work to do until its brand is defined
25.01.19 13:45:42<stoopkid> this is basically equivalent to saying you don't write a program until you know its specs, but with a much broader interpretation of "specs"
25.01.19 13:52:54<stoopkid> so these analysts gave me an exercise: try to define your own personal brand in a short paragraph
25.01.19 13:53:26<stoopkid> and indeed, currently i find that i can't
25.01.19 13:53:40<stoopkid> i could maybe define it in an essay
25.01.19 13:54:40<stoopkid> and i can define other brands, but none that quite sums up "what it is that i'm personally about"
25.01.19 13:57:58<stoopkid> it took me a while to realize, for example, that in some sense i split my mind up into different parts that i keep separate
25.01.19 13:58:44<stoopkid> ex. when i go apply for a job, i'm purposely omitting the vast majority of what it is that i'm about
25.01.19 13:59:05<stoopkid> when i think about branding for freelancing, i'm purposely omitting the vast majority of what it is that i'm about
25.01.19 13:59:41<stoopkid> these forbes analysts would ask: why?
25.01.19 14:00:42<stoopkid> i could go through my justifications for it, like ex. i don't want the potential employer to know that i'm a socialist/anarchist, only really interested in supporting co-ops, and that i hate their software stack
25.01.19 14:01:02<stoopkid> and these forbes analysts would again ask: why?
25.01.19 14:01:17<stoopkid> they'd say: make a brand out of that
25.01.19 14:06:33<stoopkid> they'd say: how are all these co-ops gonna find your services or differentiate you from the rest unless you're advertising that in your branding
25.01.19 14:10:10<stoopkid> or, how would people get a sense of the full variety of work you would want to do, along with a sense of where exactly are the boundaries of that
25.01.19 14:11:06<stoopkid> say i market myself as a web dev... does this mean *anything* web-dev? well, no...; does it mean *only* web dev? well... also no, i would actually prefer to work on other things
25.01.19 14:11:39<stoopkid> so web dev is a really bad personal brand for myself
25.01.19 14:16:33<stoopkid> but there is definitely some web dev stuff i would work on; literally anything for any worker-owned business for example; the web stuff i wouldn't want to work on is mostly a matter of whether or not i support that particular organization
25.01.19 14:26:19<stoopkid> i could generalize to software dev, but similar thing, it's not all software, and not necessarily limited to software, actually most of the things i would actually want to work on don't have anything to do with software and the software is just a means to many different ends
25.01.19 14:34:22<stoopkid> and then most of the stuff i've actually been working on with software dev has nothing to do business, most of it has literally just been researching how to potentially side-step reliance on a) proprietary software, with a goal of full personal control over your personal computing, and b) centralized services, with a goal of replacing them with decentralized public utilities
25.01.19 14:35:30<stoopkid> and i still have those goals but most of the paid software work i could get would literally be for the purposes of producing proprietary software w/ centralized services for a business that probably really strongly disagree with
25.01.19 14:35:51<stoopkid> that i*
25.01.19 14:47:14<stoopkid> so branding myself as a software dev at all is fairly counterproductive to my actual goals; most of the software *products* i want to produce would just be open-source freeware, there are software services i want to provide but only to the right businesses, and ideally i would be not just trying to give them the functionality they're demanding but actually fit them into the open-source & decentralized ecosystems
25.01.19 14:57:55<stoopkid> some of my goals are actually purely economic, ex. i want to have a direct stake in many different parts of local industry and actually network the co-ops to share capital resources and cooperate on shared projects to actually have like a self-sustaining and non-exploitative economy
25.01.19 15:15:24<stoopkid> now, that's starting to get quite a ways away from what i'm actually capable of providing right now, but no wonder, since while i've seriously considered that kind of stuff, i've never seriously incorporated it into any of my actual work, leaving it as an abstract hypothetical, and certainly not communicating it to anybody who might be able to materially support it
25.01.19 15:16:28<stoopkid> and then instead of addressing whatever issues prevent me from doing that, i say something like "well maybe i should just stick to web dev for now"
25.01.19 15:19:37<stoopkid> apparently the forbes analysts would just call that "procrastination"
25.01.19 15:26:24<stoopkid> so i can see now that my inability so far to clearly define all of my objectives even to myself, and then commit to working under that definition, has been a major contributing factor in my general failures in life especially surrounding my employment
25.01.19 15:28:57<stoopkid> and then also in my open-source work, leaving pretty much everything open to indefinite scope creep (and usually in the "wrong" direction)
25.01.19 15:37:16<stoopkid> we *almost* did all this with the software for immortality thing, but then didn't, i'd say mostly because we just did pretty much exactly like we were doing before that and just continued to focus only on the tech
25.01.19 15:38:57<stoopkid> cause i think we were pretty much on the right track in our initial discussions of it and the things we started doing right after that cleaning things up and starting to get a couple more resources out there, but then i guess we just focused on the job we were already getting paid for and never actually built that brand that we were talking about
25.01.19 15:42:12<stoopkid> so i guess the best i can sum up my essay of a "personal brand" there would be: "Cooperative economic & technical solutions"
25.01.19 15:44:32<stoopkid> "cooperative economic solutions" ex. worker's cooperatives, fair trade, local sustainable agriculture, etc.., also the political aspects are implicit in "cooperative" ex. socialism, anarchism, etc..
25.01.19 15:45:08<stoopkid> government-sponsored open-data projects, etc..
25.01.19 15:46:47<stoopkid> and then "cooperative technical solutions", seems to maybe encompass: open-source software & open data, decentralized public utilities, and full personal control over personal computing (maybe in the sense of "you need my cooperation in order to exert control over my machines")
25.01.19 15:47:26<stoopkid> (or my content, identity, etc..)
25.01.19 15:48:17<stoopkid> or maybe in the sense of, it's not really "cooperative" if the people "cooperating" don't have full control over their own "cooperation"
25.01.19 15:55:53<stoopkid> now, i said the "cooperative economic solutions" stuff seems quite a far stretch from a service i'm actually able to provide right now, but on the other hand, if i didn't have any "cooperative economic solutions", how could i start a cooperative software dev company in the first place? by the time we had everything figured out wrt our branding, marketing, scheduling, payment processing, accounting, and policy as a
                 <stoopkid> cooperative organization, we would actually have that..
25.01.19 16:12:26<stoopkid> maybe there's some umbrella term for "economic & technical" that doesn't dilute the meaning

29.01.19 16:26:42<editable-dog>hey
29.01.19 16:30:13<stoopkid> yo
29.01.19 16:31:39<editable-dog>ok well, i guess thats more motivation for me to finally clean up the repo
29.01.19 17:47:24<editable-dog>i actually feel that i'm/we're in a much better position now, wrt actually presenting some finished work and writing about it
29.01.19 17:53:04<editable-dog>wrt my job search, i didnt hear back from the bootcamp guys, but im still keeping hope
29.01.19 17:53:55<editable-dog>im gonna wait one more month, thats when i was supposed to start
29.01.19 17:54:19<editable-dog>i still have things to do
29.01.19 17:56:27<editable-dog>so, in one month, either they will get back to me, or i'll review all the other offers, check out what new opportunities are out there, and i'll go for one of them, i guess
29.01.19 17:57:28<editable-dog>money should last somewhat longer, but ideally i'd like to keep some reserve
29.01.19 17:58:11<editable-dog>so, what i meant by the frontend dev, i'd like to make a better proof trace visualizer
29.01.19 17:58:44<editable-dog>right now pyco dumps the whole tree at every step, i want to make it incremental
29.01.19 17:59:26<editable-dog>because ive been trying to finish the ldl stuff, but the visualization we have now isnt up to the task
29.01.19 18:00:25<editable-dog>ive made some progress and at least finished a couple of bugs in pyco, but it was a huge struggle
29.01.19 18:19:52<stoopkid> probably a good idea, wanna go over the details tomorrow? i'll be busy tonight cause the semester just started
29.01.19 18:20:10<stoopkid> we could probably make pretty quick work of that tho
29.01.19 18:41:46<editable-dog>yeah, cool, im not in a hurry
29.01.19 18:42:17<editable-dog>not even sure if ill have already started poking at the trace generation code
29.01.19 18:42:52<editable-dog>yeah it seems like a reasonably sized task

01.02.19 06:43:08<editable-dog>so, i was thinking about tracing, and id like to avoid any half-assed solutions
01.02.19 06:43:27<editable-dog>especially if you can help out too
01.02.19 06:43:49<editable-dog>so, the goal is not slowing the reasoner too much with it
01.02.19 06:44:27<editable-dog>so, i already got the kbdbg output describe all rules when the reasoner is starting
01.02.19 06:44:43<editable-dog>the format is n3, so im thinking we could load that with some rdf.js
01.02.19 06:45:40<editable-dog>next, im splitting the tracing output into 100mb files, which i found is about the max that the browser can load at once
01.02.19 06:47:37<editable-dog>maybe we could talk about a different scheme for this if we want to engage a backendd for the webapp, but i dunno
01.02.19 06:48:09<editable-dog>ok lets keep this detail irrelevant and state it like this: the tracing output should be a stream with:
01.02.19 06:49:21<editable-dog>every once in a while, a full dump of the reasoner state. This is all the coro states (and their locals'es)
01.02.19 06:50:19<editable-dog>after this full dump, we will keep writing just incremental changes
01.02.19 06:50:29<editable-dog>state with id and parent id added/removed
01.02.19 06:51:05<editable-dog>variable bound/unbound, i guess
01.02.19 06:52:29<editable-dog>so every once in a while, there will be a full dump, they are not so costly, theyre already implemented (sans the locals part), and they'll make seeking usable
01.02.19 07:54:58<editable-dog>think i should probably change the name of the repo?
01.02.19 07:55:15<editable-dog>i just have a bit of an issue with AutoNomic, its a beautiful name, but not googleable

04.02.19 13:35:28<stoopkid> yo
04.02.19 13:37:18<stoopkid> ended up being busy all weekend and now i've got some more school assignments to do today but yea hopefully tomorrow or wednesday i can actually start looking at it
04.02.19 13:43:01<stoopkid> wrt no half-assed solutions, i'm always in agreement w/ that, though i'll leave it up to you make the determination wrt whether some proposed solution is half- or full- assed
04.02.19 13:43:47<stoopkid> since if left to my own devices i seem to always end up like "well i guess i have to build a computer now"
04.02.19 13:47:16<stoopkid> my assignments won't take too long i could probably start looking at the code tonight but maybe we should just spend some time first writing up a plan for it
04.02.19 13:49:18<stoopkid> wrt slowing down the reasoner.. not sure whether that's an important concern for the tracing, the user is obv much more limited in speed w/ examining the trace than the actual reasoning and trace-outputting combined
04.02.19 13:49:45<stoopkid> like 99% of the time it should just be waiting on the user
04.02.19 13:50:35<stoopkid> but then maybe the user wants to "collapse" some of the things, like maybe you just wanna see it spit out the results-list in the same interface
04.02.19 13:53:38<stoopkid> i would maybe even think if we wanted to show a collapsed view of the *entire* proof trace, no matter how large it is, and let a user expand *any* section, at *any* time, we should do maybe like a breadth-first search instead and even repeat the reasoning under particular collapsed sections rather than actually storing it
04.02.19 13:56:38<stoopkid> so then we don't have trace-output slowing down the inferencing hardly at all because we're not trace-outputting anything that we're not immediately displaying
04.02.19 13:59:18<stoopkid> so you could have like two modes for that: 1) just start tracing, don't wait for results, i.e. you don't get a result until you actually expand the trace out to where it reaches a result; 2) wait for results and then display a collapsed proof-trace
04.02.19 14:01:23<stoopkid> so in the first mode, we're basically only waiting on the user, not worrying about trace slowing it down; in the 2nd mode we're not worried about trace slowing it down because we've decoupled the inferencing from the trace-outputting for the purposes of printing out the results-list before actually stepping into the trace output tree, and then at that point we're back to the situation of just waiting on the user
04.02.19 14:07:09<stoopkid> or some kind of combination of that
04.02.19 14:07:23<stoopkid> wrt the name, yea... AutoNomic was an unfortunate choice
04.02.19 14:07:45<stoopkid> it sounds good, but that's maybe ironically part of the problem :)
04.02.19 14:08:40<stoopkid> plus it's also already a regular word
04.02.19 14:11:48<stoopkid> idk, i'm not good at names :)
04.02.19 14:13:50<stoopkid> AutoNomic-pyco is more searchable but pyco is probably just a temporary phase for AutoNomic so.. i kind of feel like AutoNomic itself needs to change too
04.02.19 14:16:56<stoopkid> maybe we should just decouple the underlying inferencer from the "AutoNomic decentralized nomic blockchain"
04.02.19 14:22:17<stoopkid> so we could maybe just have a basic "univar" inferencer, and maybe try to figure out how to make the built-ins be easily extensible so that we can make AutoNomic just be a special set of built-ins over the independent univar system
04.02.19 14:30:14<stoopkid> wrt ldl... honestly that's kinda where i think we should start wrt getting towards a more final phase of implementation
04.02.19 14:33:13<stoopkid> what i'd want wrt an ldl, as a starting point, would be a chosen language (syntax and semantics) for specifying unrestricted grammars over arbitrary alphabets
04.02.19 14:35:10<stoopkid> so the alphabets could be ex. binary... ascii (which is really just a special case (or cases) of binary)... unicode (which is actually *not* just a special case of binary).. etc..
04.02.19 14:36:32<stoopkid> so ex. if i want to type a grammar that specifies some binary files, it needs to actually be interpreted as binary and not ex. ascii-encoded or unicode-valued 0s and 1s
04.02.19 14:36:41<stoopkid> or vice-versa
04.02.19 14:42:52<stoopkid> so ofc the general format for an unrestricted grammar is simple, and we don't have to be auto-generating parsers for all of them ofc, so the core of that is fairly straight-forward but there's a decent amount that actually needs to happen wrt the semantics of the choice of alphabet
04.02.19 14:43:53<stoopkid> so for example.. i don't actually directly type binary on this keyboard i type in ascii-encoded 0s and 1s (i'm pretty sure)
04.02.19 14:45:00<stoopkid> so things have to exist in the program to take into account the semantic interpretation of what i'm typing as binary 0s and 1s, or as unicode-valued 0s and 1s, or etc..
04.02.19 14:46:08<stoopkid> so ex.. the set of strings i can directly type on my particular keyboard is a grammar
04.02.19 14:46:58<stoopkid> and other strings over other alphabets have encodings in this, which are also grammars
04.02.19 14:48:13<stoopkid> so basically i think it really just needs to start with a well laid out system for "syntax and semantics of strings themselves, relative to user input"
04.02.19 14:55:22<stoopkid> so basically just an unrestricted grammar language but with a well-defined system for switching out the underlying alphabet, and a way to collect all your languages into "here is every single one of my languages" (as opposed to random grammar files scattered around various repos in your file-system)
04.02.19 14:58:19<stoopkid> now.. it should also be self-hosting
04.02.19 15:02:39<stoopkid> what that means wrt the semantic interpretation is kind open for interpretation but at the very least it should have a grammar (or grammars) describing itself (possibly specialized to the platform it's running on)
04.02.19 15:07:29<stoopkid> having all that in place, i would want to add some stuff that allows you to describe a program as having input in one grammar over some alphabet and output in another grammar over another alphabet
04.02.19 15:10:15<stoopkid> so ex.. hexASCII -> binary (which should probably have extra labeling as being just an alphabet-encoding); C++ -> ELF x86 binary; JSON <-> XML <-> RDF
04.02.19 15:17:39<stoopkid> so basically you would attach metadata to files that describe their grammar, and metadata to programs describing that they take input in one grammar and give output in another, so it's just interpreting grammars as sets, files as objects in those sets, and then is interpreting certain programs be edges in a directed graph where these sets are the objects
04.02.19 15:19:32<stoopkid> no type-system or anything yet so... it's ok if things are wrongly labeled at this point it should just be keeping track of intentions, but at least have it be well-defined what specific grammar is actually intended, even if this isn't actually enforced yet
04.02.19 15:24:22<stoopkid> only issue i might have with describing the unrestricted grammar system in N3 is that the standards are specifically unicode-valued and we'd have to add extra interpretation beyond what's in the standards to account for binary (i think? i think we certainly do in our implementation at least)
04.02.19 15:30:31<stoopkid> so ex. if i have a binary term that's say.. 5 bits long, and another term that's 3 bits long, that's gonna suck to describe in terms of something that can only see bytes
04.02.19 15:35:26<stoopkid> and then some things are gonna be easiest to type in as hexASCII, like a specific op-code, but it shouldn't be like "ok and then go pass that to xxd to translate it from hexASCII to actual binary", all that kind of basic character translation stuff should be abstracted away before any actual interpretation of grammars is built over it
04.02.19 15:46:21<stoopkid> i'm thinking the only built-in alphabet we need is the one for binary
04.02.19 15:48:34<stoopkid> https://www.archive.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf
04.02.19 15:50:25<stoopkid> so, look at figures 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 on page 2
04.02.19 15:52:53<stoopkid> so this self-hosting compiler is extending the escape characters it can interpret
04.02.19 15:54:58<stoopkid> first you add `if "\v" then return interpretation of "\v"`, then after recompiling your compiler, you can change that line to `if "\v" then return "\v"` and your compiler will still work
04.02.19 15:55:37<stoopkid> if you recompile this new code you'll get the same binary for the compiler again, but with different (more convenient) source
04.02.19 16:03:15<stoopkid> i don't know how well this would actually work for totally arbitrary changes, but at least for the purposes of just extending character sets i think it could be a clean method of implementation if we could work out a good pattern just for that purpose
04.02.19 16:34:42<stoopkid> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation#Futamura_projections
04.02.19 18:00:04<stoopkid> i'd maybe also want to see if we could base any of what we're doing wrt the inferencer or ldl around the work in the Bootstrappable Builds project

05.02.19 07:27:48<sirccloud> My issue with AutoNomic-pyco is more with the -pyco part, it would be nice to have one repo forever
05.02.19 07:28:38<sirccloud> Anyway, i keep working in univar for now lol
05.02.19 08:15:15<editable-dog>as on arbitrary alphabets...we may want to define an extended version of n3(rdf?) that has binary literals, sure
05.02.19 08:19:09<editable-dog>but...say i wanted to parse a binary file with ldl now..i'd proabably add a builtin that reads a file and returns a list like (1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 ..)
05.02.19 08:20:41<editable-dog>well, if it was like ("1

05.02.19 08:21:29<editable-dog>you get it, digits enclosed it quotes, then my ldl can already work with it without any adjustments
05.02.19 08:23:22<editable-dog>from a practical perspective, since ive been holding off actually worrying about unicode support, it would be neat if we would use our own rule system for it
05.02.19 08:24:20<editable-dog>but i dont know how to go about partially evaluating/optimizing/compiling a set of rules to make it fast enough for parctical purposes
05.02.19 08:28:00<editable-dog>honestly im more concerned with building towards the practical applications that i have in mind
05.02.19 08:28:11<editable-dog>while keeping the system extensible both upwards and downwards ofc
05.02.19 08:29:14<editable-dog>self-hosting - yes, thats what im attempting, although i think of it more as self-describing

05.02.19 13:16:42<stoopkid> i'd be cool w/ extending the n3 inferencer to handle arbitrary alphabets, or even just binary literals, instead of building a new system for it. one way we could do that would be to make IRIs from some namespace to represent characters in different alphabets, describe encodings of them into literals, and maybe even add some built-ins allowing to treat string literals as lists
05.02.19 13:18:14<stoopkid> from my experience writing binary and hex, you don't want to be writing "1" "0" "1", it's 4x as many characters and a lot harder to think and type, w/ shifts and punctuation chars
05.02.19 13:19:10<editable-dog>i already have strXlst
05.02.19 13:19:17<stoopkid> iow you want to be able to type actual "strings" (let's define as: typeable lists w/ members in the alphabet, represented directly by simple concatenation of the characters)
05.02.19 13:19:21<editable-dog>just hunting a bug in it lol
05.02.19 13:20:22<editable-dog>yeah we can do some to and from string everywhere
05.02.19 13:20:34<editable-dog>no need for true new kinds of rdf literals
05.02.19 13:23:14<stoopkid> so maybe the only new semantics we really need is just at the I/O boundary when reading/writing binary files (and maybe some optimized builtins for functions on binary data, like bitwise logical operations, shifts, etc..)
05.02.19 13:23:59<stoopkid> it needs to be able to take input and give output in the right binary formats, i guess that's really the only "special" thing
05.02.19 13:26:09<stoopkid> ah hrm, i forgot about the "lexical form" and "datatype IRI" components of a literal
05.02.19 13:26:10<stoopkid> https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal
05.02.19 13:29:17<stoopkid> so hrm, is there a list of standard datatype IRIs and does it include binary?
05.02.19 13:35:03<stoopkid> https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-mt-20040210/#DTYPEINTERP
05.02.19 13:38:19<stoopkid> so i guess RDF actually did leave it specifically open for us, and XSD: namespace i guess would be the default standard
05.02.19 13:43:24<stoopkid> hrm, so they have boolean and hexBinary, but not bitSequence
05.02.19 13:46:57<stoopkid> https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#hexBinary
05.02.19 13:50:33<stoopkid> so, that's basically exactly what it should do; "inside of" n3 you type strings in hexASCII, but applying the xsd:hexBinary datatype to the strings means that it will input/output that in terms of the actual binary that it's representing
05.02.19 13:51:23<stoopkid> but it should be able to do that with pure bit-sequences too so we might have to add that one as our own built-in
05.02.19 14:14:48<stoopkid> https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-xsch-datatypes/#sec-userDefined
05.02.19 14:16:28<stoopkid> so i guess my question now is, do the RDF + XMLSchema specs contain enough semantics for describing RDF datatype IRIs for representing strings in arbitrary user-defined alphabets
05.02.19 14:18:01<stoopkid> i.e. can i write a triple-set that defines a new RDF datatype IRI, such that it will actually work relative to RDF + XMLSchema spec semantics
05.02.19 14:23:47<stoopkid> well, actually simpler than that, we really only want a particular subset of datatypes, namely strings over some finite alphabet
05.02.19 14:25:35<stoopkid> https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string
05.02.19 14:57:15<stoopkid> so, on the programming side we basically just need a small abstraction layer that will parse strings from binary files in an arbitrary binary-encoded alphabet, and then a means to signal which alphabet we're using
05.02.19 14:57:43<stoopkid> so that's maybe equivalent to what the semantics of this is supposed to be? https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charencoding
05.02.19 15:02:51<editable-dog>all i have to say is .. damn segfaults
05.02.19 15:17:56<stoopkid> interesting chicken-vs-egg problem here: https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-guessing
05.02.19 15:22:34<stoopkid> so XML does leave it open to switch out the interpretation of their characters to arbitrary encodings, so that would include bitstrings represented by ascii 1s and 0s, or whatever we'd want (in that sense, their hexBinary and base64Binary built-in datatypes might be redundant)
05.02.19 15:24:50<stoopkid> and they provide the mechanism to signal the choice, and they provide some fairly complex builtins for defining user-defined types, so i guess now we'd want to see if you can actually apply the latter to make something recognized as a character encoding
05.02.19 15:25:21<stoopkid> and then really we'd want to see if RDF itself has this kind of semantics already in its standards
05.02.19 15:27:03<stoopkid> the XML goes further with it, in XML they're not just dealing with character-encodings for literals they're dealing with character-encodings for the entire document
05.02.19 16:04:59<editable-dog>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTf5j9LDObk
05.02.19 16:05:02<editable-dog>still rocks
05.02.19 16:05:30<editable-dog>ive really been ignoring even literal datatypes for now
05.02.19 16:06:09<editable-dog>if you have a "0" and a 0 in one testcase, it doesnt compile
05.02.19 16:51:03<stoopkid> interesting to note the IANA registration process for language tags in section 3 here: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt
05.02.19 20:01:30<stoopkid> so it looks like XML specs do define a way to construct a boolean-list data-type from their built-in boolean type
05.02.19 20:02:33<stoopkid> it also looks like we can use that to handle arbitrary data-types
05.02.19 20:02:41<stoopkid> i mean, arbitrary alphabets
05.02.19 20:07:24<stoopkid> https://www.w3schools.com/xml/el_list.asp
05.02.19 20:08:31<stoopkid> ok so then we just need a way to define the alphabets themselves
05.02.19 20:09:09<stoopkid> using the boolean data-type, it kind of gets into the question of... what actually is a boolean
05.02.19 20:11:08<stoopkid> if i say "a list of booleans" do i necessarily mean a binary file? in many programming languages  and probably XML processors too it will actually specifically not mean this
05.02.19 20:12:24<stoopkid> the XML specs don't seem to force an interpretation on this, i.e. the "value" of a boolean literal is just the abstract concept of that boolean, implemented however you've implemented it
05.02.19 20:14:48<stoopkid> which is nice that they leave it open that we *can* interpret a binary file as providing this data, but also not quite where we need it as it doesn't give the option to force that interpretation
05.02.19 20:22:03<stoopkid> hrm.. the hexBinary and base64Binary data types do seem to force the interpretation in their value spaces
05.02.19 20:24:22<stoopkid> so we could maybe treat boolean lists as always being short-hand for 4 booleans, to map into hex chars
05.02.19 20:25:19<stoopkid> or i mean, always with trailing 0s added to make it a multiple of 4 bools to map into the hexBinary value space
05.02.19 20:28:40<stoopkid> so the only complication with that is compositionality of bit-sequences
05.02.19 20:30:57<stoopkid> hrm.. actually there are some issues with this in general; if you want to store a reference to less than 8 bits, you need more data than the bits you're actually storing in order to indicate that you actually don't want the whole byte
05.02.19 20:32:15<stoopkid> so you actually can't store a non-multiple-of-8 amount of bits in a totally "flat" binary format, it needs to have some extra metadata attached to tell what bits in the final byte are actually relevant
05.02.19 20:44:37<stoopkid> and then that metadata is ultimately contained in some bytes so.. i guess maybe bit-level processing really should be a higher level of abstraction
05.02.19 20:46:06<stoopkid> even moreso since you need complex instructions to do bit-level manipulations
05.02.19 20:46:51<stoopkid> otoh, i would probably want that abstraction layer to be taken care before going further into ldl
05.02.19 20:46:57<stoopkid> taken care of*
05.02.19 20:48:09<stoopkid> so the issue is for describing, say, x86 opcodes
05.02.19 20:48:35<stoopkid> they're complex instructions divided up into 2 or 3 or 4 bit chunks that mean different things..
05.02.19 20:50:29<stoopkid> if we were describing a grammar for that, we would want to be able to describe it directly in terms of those chunks (even if we only ever store or process 8-bit or N-bit chunks at a time due to the way our particular processor works)
05.02.19 20:52:41<stoopkid> i think the issue here with boolean vs. hexBinary & base64Binary is that the latter two define themselves in terms of "bytes" and "flat binary files", which.. we implicitly assume we know what that means.. as being a flat array of *physical* octets of bits
05.02.19 20:53:28<stoopkid> "boolean" otoh... just specifies that it's the abstract concept of boolean values
05.02.19 20:54:24<stoopkid> makes it more obvious that what we mean by "binary" is not quite as straightforward
05.02.19 20:55:04<stoopkid> "byte" could hypothetically be an arbitrary sequence of booleans, regardless of format but.. we obv wouldn't interpret it that way because of... well.. "byte" always means 8 physical bits
05.02.19 21:18:26<stoopkid> so to store binary chunks of arbitrary length, you only need 3 extra bits, but ofc you can only store that using a whole byte so it's always 1 more byte than the actual length of the file
05.02.19 21:18:43<stoopkid> so to store specifically 1 bit, you actually need 2 bytes
05.02.19 21:20:16<stoopkid> to store 0 bits though, you can use 1 byte
05.02.19 21:21:36<stoopkid> i think that's probably the space-optimal representation
05.02.19 21:27:53<stoopkid> does it make sense to store 0 bits? sure it's representing an empty list of bits
05.02.19 21:31:29<stoopkid> so i'd think probably the reason that byte can always be interpreted to mean 8 ordered consecutive physical bits in a single unit that the machine can process, and boolean can't be is probably exactly this, the machine needs more complex data-format and processing for anything smaller than the single unit it can process, which has historically always been a byte at a time. "boolean" actually is a more complex thing,
                 <stoopkid> for any machine that only processes in chunks bigger than a boolean at a time
05.02.19 21:35:33<stoopkid> so you need some kind of abstraction layer above it, but everything's always represented in terms of the smallest chunk the machine can see at a time
05.02.19 21:37:16<stoopkid> hypothetically this should actually be taken into account in the standards but idk that would probably fall under something more like... posix standards or something..
06.02.19 01:46:04<stoopkid> so, we should probably define our own namespace
06.02.19 01:47:39<stoopkid> i think with enough checking of specs and taking as liberal as possible interpretation of them we could probably find a way to smash bit-sequence representation into something approximately like i would want it but another route is to just define our own namespace and assert the semantics we want directly
06.02.19 01:49:49<stoopkid> so this gets into a question... how do we "get" a namespace ?
06.02.19 01:50:36<stoopkid> imo the answer is probably public key crypto
06.02.19 01:51:31<stoopkid> i kinda want to address some general naming issues while we're going over these basics
06.02.19 01:52:39<stoopkid> ultimately we can't really "own" a human-readable namespace, or really any namespace that we can't cryptographically sign the contents of it
06.02.19 01:54:39<stoopkid> like, how do you actually "own" a URI or IRI? some DNS registrar sells it to you basically
06.02.19 01:56:15<stoopkid> even w/ namecoin... it's decentralized but still needs a block-chain and then what if that crashes for w/e reason? even in that event the public-key crypto for just having a globally unique address still works
06.02.19 02:04:08<stoopkid> so basically, anything in the specs that calls for some centralized service (including a block-chain) to allocate names/numbers/codes, i want to explicitly call that deprecated functionality that we're only maintaining backwards-compatibility with, and add replacement functionality that handles it purely in terms of user-chosen naming, optionally enforceable via crypto
06.02.19 02:05:32<stoopkid> we don't necessarily have to implement all that crypto yet ofc, but i would basically want to at least keep track of where we're gonna be diverging from the standards to add that kind of stuff
06.02.19 02:17:34<stoopkid> so the question here would be: are there well-formed URIs and IRIs that we can use that aren't interpreted by those standards to have their referents be indicated by some sort of registry?
06.02.19 02:19:58<stoopkid> ex. <https://<my-public-key>.com/>, definitely a syntactically wellformed IRI but.. technically considered to be "owned" by VeriSign according to ICANN
06.02.19 02:24:21<stoopkid> do we care what ICANN thinks? maybe not, but we should maybe go under a) the IETF-approved design strategy "be conservative in what you send"; b) probably assume unless we have good indication otherwise that the web specifications we're using don't actually indicate that some registry is interpreted by the specs to have authority over the namespace we're going to be pulling names from
06.02.19 02:26:51<stoopkid> err, probably assume unless we have good indication otherwise that the namespaces indicated in the web standards *are* interpreted by those standards to be allocated by some registry, ex. ICANN/IANA/Unicode/whatever
06.02.19 02:36:38<stoopkid> ex. language tags seem to be something that's allocated by an IANA registry
06.02.19 02:39:01<stoopkid> same with Unicode character groups, not entirely sure about URIs / IRIs or whether or not there's a space of URIs/IRIs we could use for this purpose
06.02.19 02:39:55<stoopkid> there's IANA registered charsets, IANA registered IP addresses, etc..
06.02.19 02:40:41<stoopkid> we want to maintain within the web standards as much as possible, but make sure that there's still clear distinction as to the referent of our "IRIs" (or whatever equivalent, if we need an equivalent that isn't technically an IRI)
06.02.19 02:42:50<stoopkid> i.e. there's nothing stopping you from making <https://<my-public-key>.com/> but then there's still nothing stopping VeriSign from assigning that actual domain name to some other actual server
06.02.19 02:43:53<stoopkid> that other server might not be able to sign for <my-public-key>, but what do the standards actually recognize?
06.02.19 04:27:05<editable-dog>well thats what protocols are for
06.02.19 04:27:08<editable-dog>onion://

06.02.19 17:21:24<stoopkid> not sure if you saw my discussions w/ dmiles in #logicmoo about the binary file processing thing; i realized the actual problem is more complex than i originally thought because ofc you can't use fully arbitrary character encodings, unless you're willing to accept ambiguity of parsing already at the level of character tokenizing
06.02.19 17:23:59<stoopkid> so i tried to see if there's actually a general algorithm that will determine whether a particular character encoding is unambiguous. looks like there is because you can make a regex for arbitrary character encodings: (char1 | char2 | ... | charN)*, and apparently there's an algorithm for deciding if a regex is ambiguous
06.02.19 17:26:51<stoopkid> it also looks like unambiguity is actually maybe a weaker criteria than having characters be "self-delimiting" (i guess unambiguous with no lookahead)
06.02.19 17:28:11<stoopkid> i.e. that you can read the next character w/o having to read any more than the next character
06.02.19 17:36:26<stoopkid> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5253816/are-there-such-a-thing-as-ll0-parsers
06.02.19 17:37:29<stoopkid> hrm, not sure if "no lookahead" is quite the criteria i'm looking for there, since each of the different chars is a possible production
06.02.19 17:44:34<editable-dog>well, i noticed it
06.02.19 17:46:43<stoopkid> well, you don't need to read it or anything, the conclusion was basically just 1) what i wrote just now; 2) still not quite sure whether binary literals can be crammed into plain RDF+XML semantics
06.02.19 17:49:22<editable-dog>i'll trust your conclusions
06.02.19 17:51:57<editable-dog>i'll just finish the code to serialize this initial ldl and then life will be good
06.02.19 18:15:07<stoopkid> ok so the proper criteria for self-delimiting is that tokenizing a char will only require at most as many bits of lookup as the number of bits in that char, so we can say at least that it's LL(k bits) at most where k is the max number of bits in a char
06.02.19 18:22:20<stoopkid> i think a consequence of these criteria (definitely at least the first criteria) is that no character can contain another character; is that also sufficient criteria?
06.02.19 18:26:27<stoopkid> i think that is sufficient criteria; if you've read out far enough to determine that you've matched a character, and you know that no other character can contain that character, then you know you don't have to read any farther
06.02.19 18:33:17<editable-dog>hm, i think theres a name for this
06.02.19 19:27:43<editable-dog>prefix code
06.02.19 19:27:55<editable-dog>i guess you already knew that
06.02.19 20:01:50<stoopkid> nope
06.02.19 20:02:56<stoopkid> so if you have a sorted list of codes, there's a linear time algorithm to determine if it's a prefix code
06.02.19 20:06:07<stoopkid> just go through the list, taking the nth and (n+1)th codes, pick the shorter one, which will have k bits, and xor that with the first k bits of the longer one; if it's 0, then fail and it's not a prefix code, and if it's non-zero then continue with (n+1) and (n+2)

07.02.19 08:30:58<editable-dog>well, everyone is used to backslash escaping and it has its uses, so id add the other scheme in addition to it
07.02.19 08:35:13<editable-dog>it would be nice to be able to express the "literalness" of an escape sequence with a number instead of with the number of repetitions
07.02.19 08:36:05<editable-dog>or...not necessarily number, coz that seems kind of confusing, lets just space out the repetitions maybe
07.02.19 08:36:13<editable-dog><backslash!>

07.02.19 08:37:29<editable-dog>wait, that doesnt work
07.02.19 08:38:35<editable-dog>well maybe it does, interpreting the escape sequence would just eat off the first bang it finds

07.02.19 09:38:56<stoopkid> the issue seems less a matter of the actual backlash-prefixed encoding and more a matter of the fact that you have to read it

07.02.19 11:15:01<editable-dog>read, write, edit , check..
07.02.19 11:47:34<stoopkid> writing it's not so bad. consider ex. emacs uses \ to start typing a unicode character and then it actually renders the unicode character so you're never actually reading \'s. you could do other things too like color-coding escaped chars. then the only issue would be characters like "\n" where the backslash-prefixed escape-code is how we actually print it
07.02.19 12:02:24<stoopkid> so if you have a printable but non-typeable non-control character, like w/ unicode, you can just replace the escape sequence with the printed character. if you have a control character (ex. quote or \) then you can render the text differently like w/ color-coding. if you have a non-printable character then you need some kind of printable encoding of it. so we should probably split up the problem to treat these
                 <stoopkid> different situations as independently as possible (if possible)
07.02.19 12:05:51<stoopkid> so ex. "\n" is encoded as 0x0a but rendered as "\n" and typed the same way. literal backslash is typed and encoded as two backslashes but rendered as a single red "\". special unicode chars are typed w/ some code but rendered as the character's actual glyph and encoded by that character's actual encoding, etc...
07.02.19 12:06:45<stoopkid> in any case, the rendering is kinda more important than a lot of applications treat it, and i think even more important for an LDL
07.02.19 12:07:35<stoopkid> iow, the rendering of your character encoding should probably a first class concept the same way describing the encoding itself would be
07.02.19 12:08:22<stoopkid> otoh, the rendering could maybe just be treated as a special case of encoding
07.02.19 12:09:08<stoopkid> so you have one abstract character set and 3 encodings: the encoding you actually store the data as, the encoding you actually type the data as, and the encoding you use to actually render the data
07.02.19 12:12:37<stoopkid> and ofc for this particular purpose (of typing quoted literal strings in some source lang) that encoding has to be checked to see that it actually "plays nicely" w/ those same encodings for the source lang itself
07.02.19 12:20:16<stoopkid> i'll have to think of whether there's any general criteria for determining whether string data plays nicely w/ the source lang; not sure so far since there's multiple options for how the source lang initiates a literal data section, how it terminates it, and how it handles escaping and stuff in the middle. ex. in some languages you default to text etc..
07.02.19 12:21:30<stoopkid> i'm thinking there's a criteria that there exists at least one character in the source lang that can't be used in a literal data section w/ the same encoding that's used in the source lang
07.02.19 12:45:36<stoopkid> actually there's at least one situation where that's not the case: if nothing can terminate a literal except for an EOF, then you don't need a special character
07.02.19 12:46:27<stoopkid> ofc that wouldn't be very useful; another situation is where the lengths of strings are known before you start reading them; if they don't have to delimit themselves you don't need a special character
07.02.19 12:54:39<stoopkid> still not particularly useful, you'd have to explicitly write the length of every string in the source code before you actually write that string. otoh, both options are technically usable; there isn't anything you couldn't do in these hypothetical source languages that you couldn't do in standard language with escapes, it would just be clunky
07.02.19 13:02:56<stoopkid> that you could* do in standard languages
07.02.19 13:03:25<editable-dog>pruning duplicate results is something we want to be doing for each rule or just the query result?
07.02.19 13:03:36<editable-dog>for each rule, seems to me
07.02.19 13:04:59<stoopkid> for each rule should be fine but ofc it needs to reset when something else calls that rule
07.02.19 13:05:21<stoopkid> so, not per-rule but per-rule-call
07.02.19 13:05:34<editable-dog>right right
07.02.19 13:07:05<stoopkid> and i guess that means that if a rule is called with all non-var args then you can cut that rule-call after the first result
07.02.19 13:11:27<editable-dog>yeah
07.02.19 13:14:29<editable-dog>it would be nice to have some counters and a printout of rules that generate duplicate results
07.02.19 13:15:01<editable-dog>and it would be nice to have something analogous for grammars
07.02.19 13:15:33<stoopkid> is there anything you'd want to use those counters/printouts for in the program or would it just be for the programmer to review their kb to see if they could write those rules better to eliminate as many duplicates as possible ?
07.02.19 13:15:38<editable-dog>and some standalone functionality for finding differences between proofs
07.02.19 13:15:54<editable-dog>second case
07.02.19 13:20:40<stoopkid> the cutting prevents some of the counting, i.e. you wouldn't be able to count "how many times does this rule duplicate this result" you can only count "how many results did this rule duplicate once"
07.02.19 13:22:02<stoopkid> not sure if that really matters for the purpose
07.02.19 13:22:39<stoopkid> maybe just in case we could have the cutting and counting be done by two independent toggles
07.02.19 13:29:02<stoopkid> i'm thinking that if literals are required to be self-delimiting, and every representation of a character within a literal needs to be self-delimiting, then you basically don't have any other option but escaping the end-of-literal delimiter and the escape character itself. it seems any other solution would be basically equivalent and more complex
07.02.19 13:29:59<stoopkid> so afaict the only actual "solution" beyond what we already do w/ backslash is to mess with the relationship between typing, rendering and storing source code
07.02.19 13:32:27<stoopkid> which really means, afaict, that rendering tricks are the only available option for improvement
07.02.19 13:34:46<editable-dog>toggles sound like a good idea. im also thinking maybe also counting per pred invocation instead of rule invocation
07.02.19 13:36:44<editable-dog>hmm
07.02.19 13:42:59<stoopkid> well, you could do a number like "the next N characters are all escaped", but i'm thinking this has relatively limited utility; you basically only need it for escaping the escape character and in any other situation it would probably actually be more confusing than helpful like ex.. \3n\n
07.02.19 13:43:22<stoopkid> translating to \n\\\n; not sure if it's really an improvement
07.02.19 13:44:58<stoopkid> what might be better is using single quotes like 'n\n' but tbh i still find this more confusing than \n\\\n
07.02.19 13:45:31<stoopkid> and then that's just adding another control character that needs to be escaped
07.02.19 13:45:43<stoopkid> and it can't escape itself
07.02.19 13:45:54<stoopkid> like '''''' ?
07.02.19 13:47:00<stoopkid> you could do \' to write a single-quote inside of single-quotes but then you're using the backslash as a control character when the single-quotes were supposed to escape it, like: '\\\\\\'' ?
07.02.19 13:47:49<stoopkid> otoh, it would maybe make sense to have the single-quotes be reserved just for typing long sections of literal \'s
07.02.19 13:48:57<stoopkid> but not for other things; i.e. you generally probably do want to write the \ in \n in every case, and same with \" and \'
07.02.19 13:49:40<stoopkid> (unless you're doing rendering tricks for \" and \' instead)
07.02.19 13:51:32<stoopkid> although technically \n is superfluous if your lang lets you actually use the actual 0x0a character in your literals (i.e. multi-line literals), but then even that's kinda weird because... how should it interpret my indentation tabs? etc..
07.02.19 14:36:53<editable-dog>well there are times when multiline string is right, and times when \n is
07.02.19 14:37:19<editable-dog>also, python already has 3 string notations, ', " and """
07.02.19 14:37:57<editable-dog>and thats pretty useful, when you have a "-heavy string, you switch to ' or """
07.02.19 14:43:18<stoopkid> switching delimiters can make it easier in certain situations yea but you still end up needing escapes for whatever delimiter you do use for that particular string, and then escapes for the escape, and some way to render non-printable characters which is usually via escaping
07.02.19 14:44:47<stoopkid> and then whitespace is just kind of a weird middle ground of "printable but the way its printed doesn't necessarily make sense in all cases"
07.02.19 14:55:14<stoopkid> yea it looks like that under the fairly minimal constraints i described, it's nearly the same situation as w/ prefix-codes. the characters (as you type them into the string) have to be a prefix code over the alphabet of your source lang, and the end-of-literal delimiter is unavailable for use. you have to assign it a code, but you can only use a sequence of characters from the source lang, or otherwise you're just
                 <stoopkid> deferring the problem to the character that you replaced it with
07.02.19 14:57:54<stoopkid> so you have no way to access a the end-of-literal delimiter from within the literal unless you represent it with a sequence of multiple characters in the source lang
07.02.19 14:59:37<stoopkid> since this must still be a prefix code, that means all the prefixes of this multi-char encoding are unavailable for use, so typically it would just be a one-char prefix from the source-lang, and then *that* one is also necessarily unavailable for use just by the prefix-code conditions
07.02.19 15:00:57<stoopkid> we could say the prefix-code conditions are maybe slightly too strong... let's say "\g" is not actually an escape sequence then you could realistically have this be interpreted as literal "\" followed by literal "g", which would break the property of it being a prefix code but... "not by much"
07.02.19 15:02:42<stoopkid> so, technically you don't need to escape the escape characters in all situations
07.02.19 15:05:54<stoopkid> ex. we could say that "\\\"" actually represents \\", i.e. it tries the first two characters and says "\\" is not actually an escape-sequence, so the first \ is just a \, then try chars 2 and 3, also "\\" so the second char is also just a \, and then chars 3 and 4 are "\"" which is actually an escape sequence so this is "
07.02.19 15:07:41<stoopkid> but then, what about "\\n" ? so that interpretation gets screwed up when we're using escaped printable non-control characters to represent non-printable/whitespace characters
07.02.19 15:08:51<stoopkid> otoh, if we used a different escape-character for this situation, like %n instead of \n
07.02.19 15:09:50<stoopkid> then we could say "\%n" = literal backslash + literal newline; and "%\n" means literal %\n
07.02.19 15:10:51<stoopkid> and "%%%%%n" means %%%% + newline; "\\\\"" means \\\ + "
07.02.19 15:13:28<stoopkid> so making two escape chars, one for the situation where it's followed by a control character and one for the situation where it's followed by a non-control character, that might be able to solve most of the actual issue without requiring any rendering tricks, at the expense of a slight increase in complexity
07.02.19 15:16:00<stoopkid> the language for literals is objectively more complex from a formal grammars standpoint because the character sequences are explicitly not self-delimiting, though again, not by much; you still only need the max length of any escape sequence in order to read the next character
07.02.19 15:16:46<stoopkid> so your tokenizer can still be LL(max char length)
07.02.19 15:22:19<stoopkid> "lookahead" is kind of a misleading concept though. consider parsing by derivatives, you can parse arbitrary CFGs just one character at a time by doing tricks that will follow each possible production simultaneously. derivatives-parsing handles this by actually modifying the grammar as each character is read
07.02.19 15:24:10<stoopkid> the "lookahead" concept still applies, it still takes that many tokens to actually decide on a production rule, but if you have some way to follow each production simultaneously you don't ever have to actually "look ahead" in order to parse
07.02.19 15:46:03<stoopkid> would probably make more sense to have % be the one for literal control-characters and \ be the one for regular characters printed differently since people are used to writing things like "\n"; so "\\n" would be \ + newline; "%\n" would be \ + n; then you'd have each escape character escape the other one; so "%\" is \, "\%" is % and "\\" is \\ and "%%" is %%
07.02.19 15:47:34<stoopkid> mmm, maybe not, still tricky
07.02.19 15:51:03<stoopkid> %%%" ... would this be "%%\%"" ? and if so why wouldn't that be %\%" ? (i.e. applying the preceding % to the backslash instead of applying the backlash to the following % )
07.02.19 15:59:16<stoopkid> i guess you would write that as "%%%%""
07.02.19 16:01:21<stoopkid> i guess this works; not sure if i'm missing anything
07.02.19 16:14:00<editable-dog>https://github.com/koo5/univar/blob/master/tests/ldl/ldl0
07.02.19 16:14:01<editable-dog>finally
07.02.19 16:26:00<editable-dog>i think the duplicity check should be maybe only on pred level
07.02.19 16:27:07<editable-dog>if you have multiple rules for one pred, each yielding the same result, then the yields just unnecessarily propagate to the callers, only to eventually be pruned on a higher level
07.02.19 16:29:30<editable-dog>cutting is just a special optimization for all-consts calls, i'll leave that out for now
07.02.19 17:08:01<stoopkid> ah, yea, per pred-call
07.02.19 17:10:20<editable-dog>the fun part is gonna be the check for equality of results
07.02.19 17:11:19<editable-dog>gonna need a table of correspondences of vars
07.02.19 17:11:59<editable-dog>but i guess it shouldnt be hard
07.02.19 17:24:28<editable-dog>in traversing the bnodes, i will make the code also be able to print out everything that was checked so far and wasnt decidedly different, and show where the first difference is
07.02.19 17:24:54<editable-dog>i guess ill only want to print it for the toplevel query level

19.02.19 13:52:12<stoopkid> hey, sorry, still been pretty busy and probably still gonna be busy til like monday or so
19.02.19 13:52:44<stoopkid> me and megan are getting married this friday
19.02.19 13:57:49<stoopkid> so.. that's taken up a lot of time.. which for me is mostly just kinda blah cause for me it's really mostly just a legal status thing
19.02.19 14:01:34<stoopkid> if anything the whole thing's kind of ironic for me considering how often i still rant about abolishing the legal institution of marriage lol
19.02.19 14:04:31<stoopkid> i mean if people wanna waste a lot of money on bourgeois judeo-christian rituals to celebrate their first steps in the direction of divorce, w/e, more power to them.. but that shouldn't have much anything to do with hospital visitation rights, tax incentives, shared insurance plans, etc.. or at least nobody's convinced me yet that this should be the case
19.02.19 14:08:30<stoopkid> so to save a lot of money, megan's mom is actually an ordained minister so we're just gonna do a flash wedding at a free art museum down in baltimore and then go out to dinner with the family and then me and megan are gonna go on a cabin trip for the weekend
19.02.19 14:08:53<stoopkid> and then maybe (fingers crossed) i'll have some more free time after i get back lol
19.02.19 14:25:20<stoopkid> other thing i've been working on a bit since i'm taking physics this semester is studying into dimensional analysis and looking at its relationship with type systems
19.02.19 14:26:11<stoopkid> which is pretty interesting and doesn't seem like it's been studied nearly enough yet
19.02.19 14:26:46<stoopkid> anyway, i have to go try on suits for the wedding so ill bbl

25.02.19 15:23:41<stoopkid> weird
25.02.19 15:24:18<stoopkid> still not quite non-busy yet
25.02.19 15:26:24<stoopkid> also probably not totally got a handle on my analysis paralysis either yet
25.02.19 15:29:23<stoopkid> im thinking at least part of that is just not having a single chosen mental model for algorithms like i have for data-structures
25.02.19 15:30:00<stoopkid> (definitely also some other things i'm missing beyond that, but this is definitely one of the main things)
25.02.19 15:32:11<stoopkid> example: deducing how character encodings & escapes and such are supposed to work, etc..
25.02.19 15:32:51<stoopkid> i can actually get to an answer, or a well-defined range of acceptable vs. unacceptable answers, parameterized by particular situation etc..
25.02.19 15:34:43<stoopkid> something like ex.. "if the tokenizer can simply read off a token without needing anymore lookahead than the length of the token, then the character encoding must necessarily be a prefix code"
25.02.19 15:42:21<editable-dog>lool, gratz
25.02.19 15:43:28<editable-dog>well, thats great information to try to encode in your agdas
25.02.19 16:10:53<stoopkid> i'm thinking that it seems to be something that humans in general have difficulty with: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation
25.02.19 16:11:06<stoopkid> contrast this with the topic of information theory
25.02.19 16:11:33<stoopkid> where very very little is disputed
25.02.19 16:13:01<stoopkid> i think what i've been hoping to find is something like giunti's description at the bottom there
25.02.19 16:21:24<stoopkid> actually i guess really that (dynamical systems description), but constrained by some combination of each of the 3 other "accounts" from the "Physical phenomenon" section
25.02.19 16:24:12<stoopkid> and i guess that's sort of what i mean, once we bring in the elements of time+change, it's like "is that exactly what i mean? it definitely *almost* is but i can't tell exactly if it's missing something" and then you read something else and realize "oh yea my conception definitely was missing ex.. 'the semantic account'" or w/e whereas data-structures are just data-structures
25.02.19 16:35:57<editable-dog>well, i wouldnt necessarily bring in the space-time constraint
25.02.19 16:37:27<editable-dog>the only definition that would approach any sense of validity to me would be intentionally subjective
25.02.19 16:38:06<editable-dog>something about getting useful information out of something
25.02.19 16:38:52<editable-dog>a clock on a wall is computing time for me, but also a leaking jug of water might be
25.02.19 16:41:10<editable-dog>as on space and time, you never know when we might transcend those
25.02.19 16:42:10<editable-dog>ever managed to lucid dream?
25.02.19 16:53:51<stoopkid> nope, most of the time i don't even regular-dream
25.02.19 16:55:24<stoopkid> i've had a couple where i had some semblance of free-will / agency but nothing approaching "lucidity"
25.02.19 16:57:16<editable-dog>well, afaik theres nothing more to it than that free will, free in the sense that youre fully aware that youre actually laying in bed
25.02.19 16:59:16<stoopkid> right, nothing like that, just a couple times where i was maybe "vaguely suggesting" a direction for the dream to go, not really aware that i was actually just dreaming and not w/ any real kind of control or w/e
25.02.19 17:54:21<editable-dog>im still messing with ldl
25.02.19 17:54:37<editable-dog>progress is super slow

26.02.19 10:12:18<editable-dog>yo
27.02.19 12:17:20<stoopkid> man... i wish i had never learned anything about politics and economics; i've been looking for jobs (main reason i'm still not quite non-busy yet) and there's relatively few that i'm not just outright morally opposed to; like i have ~5% of the options i would have if i just didn't care what the product of my labor was
27.02.19 12:18:32<stoopkid> and unfortunately that's only like ~5% tolerated as an excuse for unemployment :)
27.02.19 12:21:30<stoopkid> and more unfortunately i think i need to admit to myself that i just have way way way too much analysis paralysis to be successful w/ freelancing, especially since even if i were freelancing it's still only ~5% of potential clients that i'm not just outright morally opposed to
27.02.19 12:22:27<stoopkid> i think my "personal branding" exercises helped a bit.. but.. ultimately mostly just helped me reach conclusions that were unfortunately not the conclusions i would have liked to have reached, but are nevertheless the truth
27.02.19 12:27:53<stoopkid> worse is my analysis paralysis really screws me on the main employable skill i have which is ofc sw dev
27.02.19 12:30:09<stoopkid> i do predict i could and probably eventually will reach a point where i've just actually broken through it with a workable answer to my fundamental issues that i always eventually come back to any time i get deep into some sw dev problem, but i don't think i'm there yet
27.02.19 12:35:26<stoopkid> one thing that i think will probably help me w/ that going forward is i've realized that if i want to actually develop software in the real world i can't take a formalist approach i have to take an empiricist/scientific approach (moreso since that would make me a lot more employable in my main field of relative expertise within sw dev i.e. static analysis, and yet moreso cause it's probably a fruitful direction for
                 <stoopkid> coming up with useful formal methods in the first place)
27.02.19 12:37:32<stoopkid> but i haven't really practiced that or developed a mental framework for that (already "standard" practice) empirical method of static analysis
27.02.19 12:41:44<stoopkid> and even w/ that i have to sort of unlearn this habit i've gotten into of completely depending on static analysis as a crutch for development
27.02.19 12:44:57<stoopkid> in some sense this might ultimately be the fundamental "moral" of godel's work
27.02.19 12:52:11<stoopkid> otoh, it's a bit beyond analysis-paralysis as definitely part of my analysis paralysis is due to missing critical CS basics that would have just answered many of my questions/concerns (both practical & philosophical)
27.02.19 12:53:04<stoopkid> things like, for example, simply reading the wikipedia page for "Computation"
27.02.19 12:59:56<stoopkid> certainly part of the issue is that the vast majority of CS kind of slacks on the fundamental question of "what actually is a computation in the first place"; we defer to "algorithm; a sequence of instructions", but then that itself begs further clarity; for that further clarity, we defer to *specific* systems of turing-complete computation, and then to the "equivalence class of all those under bisimulation" but even
                 <stoopkid> that doesn't address the fundamental questions/concepts raised on the wikipedia for "Computation"
27.02.19 13:01:48<stoopkid> for example it doesn't really direct address your main criteria "the only definition that would approach any sense of validity to me would be intentionally subjective
                 <stoopkid> 4:38 PM something about getting useful information out of something"
27.02.19 13:04:01<stoopkid> that would correspond to "the mapping account" on the wikipedia page, but just looking at a specific system of computation on its own doesn't tell you anything about what it's representing
27.02.19 13:05:47<stoopkid> although it does partially/indirectly address "a clock on a wall is computing time for me, but also a leaking jug of water might be", i.e. the "multiple realizability" thing mentioned on the wikipedia page
27.02.19 13:28:49<stoopkid> i don't necessarily know if we meaningfully formulate a notion of computation that isn't dependent on space & time, as even in the mapping account of getting useful information out of something, that "getting something" seems to imply some kind of time dimension where there is a previous state where you lack the information and a subsequent state where you "have" the information (also still sort of begging the question
                 <stoopkid> of what it means to "have" information)
27.02.19 13:30:14<stoopkid> this also seems to imply that a time dimension is implicit (if not explicit) in the entire field of information theory
27.02.19 13:31:29<stoopkid> that information itself then seems to be equivalent to some space dimension
27.02.19 13:32:11<stoopkid> or rather exists within some space dimension
27.02.19 13:36:12<stoopkid> so hypothetically we could maybe transcend our physical 3D space + 1D time dimensions but idk that we could transcend computational memory space + information-yielding time-steps dimensions and still keep a meaningful notion of computation or information theory
27.02.19 14:04:39<stoopkid> it also seems to imply some kind of topology on this space, to allow for a meaningful notion of "flow" of information, i.e. the topology represents the informal notion of "communications channels"
27.02.19 14:41:19<stoopkid> so, formally, information theory is based on probability theory which is based on measure theory which in turn is based on this thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-algebra
27.02.19 14:43:48<stoopkid> but i think that's mostly because information theorists have a lot of focus on assigning an actual number to the "amount" of information, but this still kind of begs the question of "what exactly is being measured"
27.02.19 14:44:55<stoopkid> but then, that's essentially what the sigma-algebra is, a space where you can "measure" its subspaces in a "reasonable" way
27.02.19 14:47:13<stoopkid> so looking at the formal definition it's given a set S, a sigma-algebra is a subset of the set of all subsets of S, that is closed under complement and countable union
27.02.19 14:48:36<stoopkid> so if the subset P is in the sigma-algebra then the set of everything not in P is also in the sigma-algebra, and if the subsets P1, P2, P3, ... are in the sigma-algebra then their union is also in the sigma-algebra
27.02.19 14:50:34<stoopkid> but what are these subsets, from an information theoretic perspective we should think that they correspond to logical propositions on objects in the base set S, cause what is it that you get "information" about? some question/proposition
27.02.19 14:51:41<stoopkid> complement corresponds to negation, and union corresponds to logical OR
27.02.19 14:57:48<stoopkid> and that's functionally complete, you can represent every boolean proposition with negation and disjunction; it's not necessarily convenient for us but in terms of just looking at what sets are selected using these connectives, all sets are represented, so ex. adding intersection (i.e. logical AND) wouldn't give us anything extra aside from convenience
28.02.19 05:42:16<editable-dog>re job searching, arent you still studying?
                 <editable-dog>i filter out allmost all job ads as well. The mentoring job didnt work out btw. So now im kinda on a lookout again, but not very seriously yet. Kinda want to finish the new proof trace viewer and the basic ldl... 
                 <editable-dog>>and still keep a meaningful notion of computation or information theory
                 <editable-dog>well, my computation and your computation will never be the same thing, so i guess what we used to tell nilli applies, you should call it stoop's general computation 1.0 and figure out what goals your definition has, ie what models does it aim to generalize etc
28.02.19 08:16:04<stoopkid> hm, possibly
28.02.19 08:21:46<stoopkid> wrt job searching, yea my parents are still helping me out w/ rent while im in school but this still leaves us just slightly above barely scraping by, so its ok that i don't have a job at the moment but less ok for me to not be actively looking for one, if that makes sense
28.02.19 08:27:39<stoopkid> plus idk, it's like not having a job is ironically more of a distraction & time-sink than having one (well, assuming they don't try to have me working 12 hours a day like at my last job)
28.02.19 08:34:40<stoopkid> i just end up spending a lot of time worrying about ex. not having a job, if i was gonna get a job which job should i get, whether i should freelance, whether instead of freelance i should work on our projects and try to figure out how to eventually monetize them or something related, etc..
28.02.19 08:36:20<stoopkid> this is really probably mostly just a time-management issue when it comes down to it but that's probably the thing i'm worst at despite lots of attempts to work on it
28.02.19 08:48:54<stoopkid> wrt "stoop's general computation 1.0", i guess my idea/hypothesis is that this should basically be able to just be information theory, with units of computation being associated with transfers of information, and programs being defined in terms of how a series of atomic information transfers leads to providing the "useful information" you're trying to extract from the computation in the first place
28.02.19 08:56:48<stoopkid> i would probably assert that the abstract computational time & space dimensions do exist as basic assumptions of the theory, due to the information-theoretic considerations, and i would maybe go further to assert that these actually do need to be mapped onto space-time (currently for practical purposes) due to time being the dimension along which we actually experience an asymmetry between a state of lacking
                 <stoopkid> information followed by having it potentially followed by losing it
28.02.19 09:02:58<stoopkid> the specific model of time might vary but it seems there's gotta be some kind of space in which we can say that information-havingness can vary
28.02.19 09:58:42<editable-dog>ok makes sense
28.02.19 09:58:48<editable-dog>>not having a job is ironically more of a distraction & time-sink than having one 
                 <editable-dog>good thinking. 
                 <editable-dog>>(well, assuming they don't try to have me working 12 hours a day like at my last job)
                 <editable-dog>my mental capacity is a lot more limited, i think about 25 hours of focused coding a week is a max for me
                 <editable-dog>my main worry right now is if i should continue making pyco usable, or try to do my ldl stuff in xsb
                 <editable-dog>anyway, i guess we should really give a try to freelancing together now, since we are both willing and able at the same time, it might not happen again. I will start monitoring upwork for anything that might seem approachable

28.02.19 11:04:14<stoopkid> idk all of these look "approachable", and others, at least with some prior negotation limiting the scope of the contracts to something reasonable relative to the price
28.02.19 11:08:57<stoopkid> the Data-Extraction-ETL gig.. i'd put that at about a week to have the bulk of it done and be at the polishing stage?

28.02.19 11:18:55<stoopkid> like, this one maybe doesn't look "approachable", but then.. relative to $15,000 ?
28.02.19 11:20:58<stoopkid> i think it would probably be completable in the amount of time that $15,000 would warrant us spending on it, which is.. quite a big chunk of time for us probably, then it's just a matter of whether or not our projections match their deadlines
28.02.19 11:29:21<stoopkid> https://www.upwork.com/job/Developer-needed-for-creating-online-tutoring-website_~01a1a2141647129cec/

28.02.19 11:42:53<stoopkid> this one not paying all that much relative to what our initial investment on this would be (looks like they want to set up a payment processing system) *but* this is probably the kind of thing that could/should be relatively routine for us if we were doing this regularly
28.02.19 15:39:44<editable-dog>wordpress isnt approachable. Ive dealt with a php cms before, and once is enough
28.02.19 15:41:37<editable-dog>i like the crypto trading bot ad, work sounds boring, but i like that the client is well-rated with long history on upwork
28.02.19 15:42:22<editable-dog>the scraping job sounds like a great deal. Funny that once i logged it, it bacame "unavailable in your location"
28.02.19 15:43:36<editable-dog>Software engineer for system creation.
28.02.19 15:43:39<editable-dog>sounds good
28.02.19 15:48:07<editable-dog>the R to python job isnt approachable..
28.02.19 15:50:15<editable-dog>the $15000 one... idk
28.02.19 15:51:40<editable-dog>they use the word "advanced" too many times
28.02.19 15:52:43<editable-dog>i'd decide if i'd see a detailed spec from them
28.02.19 15:53:04<editable-dog>"e-commerce functionality"
28.02.19 15:53:24<editable-dog>half of these bullet points could explode into a $15000 project on its own
28.02.19 15:55:46<editable-dog>online tutoring website for $1000 sounds like possibly way too little money, but its still go for it as a first project
28.02.19 15:56:57<editable-dog>data cleanup...well in a way it may be a nice job, not as demanding as sw dev
28.02.19 15:59:53<stoopkid> i figure we gotta assume they're lowballing and try to negotiate the price up and/or the feature-set down, and then potentially some kind of paid on-going support / iterations
28.02.19 16:12:25<editable-dog>sounds good
28.02.19 16:13:47<editable-dog>meh, i tried changing location to usa, so i could get my set up keywords and all the jobs i apparently cant see when logged in, but they want my tax numbers and stuff
28.02.19 16:15:55<stoopkid> hm, i haven't made an account yet
28.02.19 16:16:42<stoopkid> oh nvm i guess i did a while back
28.02.19 16:56:19<editable-dog>lots of qt jobs
28.02.19 17:04:38<editable-dog>https://www.upwork.com/job/Php-sql-add-functionality_~017933cf627dbe9e83/
28.02.19 17:05:24<editable-dog>im feeling so lazy tho, are you also feeling this lazy when actually faced with actual descriptions of actual work?
28.02.19 17:16:04<stoopkid> hm, yes/no, it's mostly just customer relations that i feel lazy about at the moment
28.02.19 18:04:18<editable-dog>hm, tomorrow i'll be trying to get done papers that i'd need for serious freelancing. Im doing it to have a more advantageous way to tax the nilli money from last year, but we can consider it a step towards freelancing too
28.02.19 18:06:12<editable-dog>i found  a couple upwork jobs that ill try to respond to i guess
28.02.19 18:08:51<editable-dog>but mostly stuff that i have some expertise in, not sure that i found anything that we could truly work together on
28.02.19 18:08:58<editable-dog>maybe a few, ill post them tomorrow
28.02.19 18:40:25<editable-dog>messing with jsonld framing today...it doesnt work
28.02.19 19:01:05<editable-dog>i cant really find anything about lists in the framing spec

01.03.19 08:31:08<stoopkid> haven't used qt yet but i'd be down to learn, it does look pretty popular
01.03.19 08:46:20<stoopkid> so i think one of our biggest hurdles (or at least one of mine) is gonna be just getting started, in the sense of just reaching out to potential clients in the first place. is that something you're also feeling lazy with or just me?
01.03.19 09:16:39<stoopkid> hm, why don't you think the R to python job is approachable?
01.03.19 09:25:21<stoopkid> we might wanna look at stuff related to CRM/ERP/BI etc.. high-value, not too inherently complicated as far as actual coding goes, and actually relevant to us starting/managing a business
01.03.19 11:49:39<editable-dog>yea crm etc is interesting
01.03.19 11:49:54<editable-dog>theres at least one company doing semweb-powered bi
01.03.19 11:51:39<editable-dog>anyway yeah its also difficult for me to get to answering these ads
01.03.19 11:51:58<editable-dog>answering the is difficult, i can go two hours writing a perfect response just to get no reply
01.03.19 11:52:12<editable-dog>or a fast response and also get no reply
01.03.19 11:57:55<editable-dog>i definitely have to get into the right mood to feel like communicating
01.03.19 11:57:59<editable-dog>and it doesnt happen often
01.03.19 11:58:21<editable-dog>i hate phone calls, either i get anxious or bored
01.03.19 12:18:37<editable-dog>well the R to python job.. it would be a hard job transcribing algorithms from a language i dont know, when i also dont understand the algorithms and the principles behind them
01.03.19 12:19:02<editable-dog>i guess if you took care of this domain knowledge part, id take care of R and python knowledge
01.03.19 12:19:05<editable-dog>not sure if it would work
01.03.19 12:20:01<editable-dog>also, its not so much money, given that what i write above, i fear that we could get stuck on something
01.03.19 12:31:57<stoopkid> i think it's doable, especially with stuff like sympy and numpy; maybe not something to start with though

01.03.19 12:48:44<editable-dog>I have been writing GUI applications in VB, Delphi, and recently two years with QT Widgets. I am strongly user-focused, with usability always in mind, but i can also work with electronics, and anywhere in-between. We have experience with PLC HMIs too.
01.03.19 12:49:05<editable-dog>https://www.upwork.com/ab/proposals/job/~015c60eca751dd3691/apply/#/
01.03.19 12:59:06<editable-dog>send?
01.03.19 12:59:16<editable-dog>hahaha: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Java-Scala-Python-Full-Stack-Software-Developer_~0188988ae4fd2975d9
01.03.19 12:59:31<editable-dog>you read all that and at the bottom: 
                 <editable-dog>You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:
                 <editable-dog>    This type of job requires to be in Ukraine or Russia and fluent Ukrainian or Russian, do you meet these requirements?
01.03.19 13:01:35<stoopkid> lol
01.03.19 13:02:41<stoopkid> two-man* and sure let's try it
01.03.19 13:03:14<editable-dog>alright, thanks
01.03.19 13:15:31<stoopkid> probably wanna do fixed price/length contracts in general but i figure at this point we probably just need to be applying as much as possible
01.03.19 13:33:53<editable-dog>hmm, do you feel like spending some time doing the research to actually answer this guy's question here? : https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Vector-blockchain-visualization-art-programming_~019c88c38dad0c5223
01.03.19 13:39:56<stoopkid> think they'd send us laser projectors to play with? :)
01.03.19 13:52:58<stoopkid> you mean this question? "If hired, give some details about the blockchain visualizer would adapt first for our software."
01.03.19 13:55:51<editable-dog>yeah
01.03.19 13:56:35<stoopkid> well, probably not the globes lol
01.03.19 13:59:08<stoopkid> https://fiatleak.com/
01.03.19 14:00:18<stoopkid> something like the stock-ticker thing at the top there, as some kind of reusable widget that you could insert into other light-shows, would probably be a good visualizer to start with
01.03.19 14:02:05<stoopkid> i'd say it's definitely at least a 2-phase job: 1) get the crypto integrations in place, 2) make fancier visualizations
01.03.19 14:02:58<stoopkid> so we would want like the simplest possible visualization that they could still actually reasonably use
01.03.19 14:04:44<stoopkid> price-ticker that you can put into other light-shows seems like it could work for that, i mean, how much serious financial analysis is somebody gonna be doing with this thing they're basically just gonna be "celebrating the fact that bitcoin is happening" with a laser light-show
01.03.19 14:08:31<stoopkid> not necessarily "just" the price-ticker thing but y'know something that's not like geometrically challenging
01.03.19 14:18:21<editable-dog>well i like playing with graphics like that
01.03.19 14:18:32<editable-dog>but ok ticker is great idea
01.03.19 14:19:22<editable-dog>but theres no single crypto integrations, we'd have to query various exchanges or whatnot
01.03.19 14:21:49<stoopkid> i wonder if they have a matrix setting
01.03.19 14:23:27<stoopkid> could definitely do a matrix version of bitcoin rain
01.03.19 14:23:56<editable-dog>ok answered
01.03.19 14:28:22<stoopkid> what did you send them? i'm gonna try to keep track of this stuff to make templates/scripts
01.03.19 14:29:33<editable-dog>We are a two-man team based in USA and Europe, with experience in both computer science research and practical software development. I have over 5 years C experience, two years QT widgets experience, and some experience with both 2D and 3D graphics and visualization. We are also building our own blockchain platform. We will do our best to move your project forward, at a reasonable price. less
                 <editable-dog>    If hired, give some details about the blockchain visualizer would adapt first for our software.
                 <editable-dog>    We are thinking a good starting point might be simply implementing a price ticker.
01.03.19 14:32:04<editable-dog>its all saved in my proposals page, we can try setting up a vnc session with a browser
01.03.19 14:32:35<editable-dog>or you could just log in with my credentials any time i suppose
01.03.19 14:34:32<stoopkid> does upwork let you make team/company accounts?
01.03.19 14:36:50<editable-dog>Agency membership
                 <editable-dog>$20/month
                 <editable-dog>Add and support unlimited multi-person teams and team members
                 <editable-dog>80 Connects/month
01.03.19 14:38:04<editable-dog>might be worth it, i was thinking that the basic $10 plan might be worth it to see competitors bids
01.03.19 14:40:30<stoopkid> 20% wasn't already enough? lol
01.03.19 14:41:46<stoopkid> yea maybe, let's wait on it though
01.03.19 14:42:00<editable-dog>what 20%?
01.03.19 14:45:02<stoopkid> doesn't upwork charge a 20% "service fee" on the price of the contract?
01.03.19 14:46:11<stoopkid> https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211062538-Freelancer-Service-Fees
01.03.19 14:50:58<editable-dog>ah
01.03.19 14:51:00<editable-dog>yeah
01.03.19 14:57:13<stoopkid> i figure for a fixed-price job we can probably filter out anything under $500 ?
01.03.19 15:02:45<stoopkid> especially after 20% fee i figure that's basically what it costs to even start a project and negotiate its completion, let alone do the actual implementation & deployment
01.03.19 15:12:35<stoopkid> for the lasers one we could hypothetically contact them directly instead of going through upwork
01.03.19 15:21:15<stoopkid> well, nvm i guess part of what they're paying upwork for is to make them look like a good employer which they get by making it look like they've spent lots of $ on lots of development and they only get that by doing at least some of it through upwork
01.03.19 15:22:34<editable-dog>i dunno, i suppose it dependes on how well the job is specified
01.03.19 15:23:07<editable-dog>i do consider even jobs like finding a bug in an arduino sketch
01.03.19 15:24:10<editable-dog>well everyone's saying that upwork only protects the clients, so yeah we probably just as well might
01.03.19 15:27:04<stoopkid> idk there's certainly cases i could imagine where i could totally just get in & get out and charge $50-$100 and feel satisfied but i'm also imagining that to be relatively low probability situation that something that small would be worth the initial "just getting our bearings on the problem" time-investment or *actually* have 0% "just get our bearings" investment
01.03.19 15:29:03<stoopkid> like by the time we've got our bearings on the problem we might've spent all day, which should already be $50-$100, and then we should assume there will be at least 1 snag, upwork is already taxing 20% and the client isn't giving much confidence that they have the right kind of budget flexibility
01.03.19 15:30:24<editable-dog>i definitely agree that bigger projects are prefferable
01.03.19 15:30:27<stoopkid> so i figure that even pursuing those jobs in the first place is gonna be a net loss except maybe in the context of on-going familiarity with a particular project, like that's maintenance service kind of fees
01.03.19 15:37:03<stoopkid> if we had a bigger team we could probably break up the tasks easier to make smaller jobs more profitable and that's something we should probably think about but with just the two of us at this point it's like thinking in terms of an hourly wage we're already spending ~$50 just to even seriously consider the job in the first place let alone take it & actually do it
01.03.19 15:47:41<stoopkid> ex. this looks approximately reasonable for a "client's initial low-ball" https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/t/1/details/~01fa84c2087755e1a9/?amount=500-&page=3&q=sql&sort=recency&user_location_match=2
01.03.19 15:51:08<editable-dog>" help update and improve functionalities" could mean anything
01.03.19 15:51:29<editable-dog>.
01.03.19 15:51:49<editable-dog>that period was my cat.
01.03.19 15:54:19<stoopkid> right and in terms of if we were imagining working hourly wage at some full-time sw dev job it might cost us $500 worth of labor just to even interact with this client and figure out what it is we even actually need to implement
01.03.19 15:56:24<stoopkid> i mean ideally with a good client it will be less but... i figure on average clients will be less good about having well-defined specifications and not trying to keep expanding the scope on us
01.03.19 15:57:17<stoopkid> plus i  figure a general rule will be that our first implementation is always wrong, no matter what
01.03.19 15:59:34<editable-dog>well, im sure such nightmarish clients abound, but in mylimted experience of doing stuff for people, .....actually there was one project where it was like that, i dont even remember now if we had some agreed on hour rate or fixed or if i was doing it just out of enthusiasm, but i ended up being dragged into having to do a ton of research and specification, and the guy was smart enough to see that and we cut it off
01.03.19 16:00:54<editable-dog>i guess we are best off approaching the high-rating clients, and approaching the rest with caution
01.03.19 16:02:19<editable-dog>and theyre doing the same
01.03.19 16:03:06<editable-dog>and we can either start building a reputation or putting up a portfolio, or both
01.03.19 16:10:11<editable-dog>and i guess we need to get into cranking out websites/apps whatever like the other folks do
01.03.19 16:10:29<stoopkid> both probably although i've tended to have trouble making a portfolio out of our own projects due to having too much room for overthinking everything
01.03.19 16:10:56<editable-dog>my problem is theres not much worth showing, it seems
01.03.19 16:11:52<editable-dog>like, my open source projects are my playground
01.03.19 16:12:10<editable-dog>i cant show what ive done at my previous job (mm actually i could show one thing)
01.03.19 16:12:33<editable-dog>i cant show the results of the maybe 4 gigs ive done over the years
01.03.19 16:13:13<editable-dog>but...yeah, with a bit of thought, maybe its possible to put something together
01.03.19 16:14:25<editable-dog>i cant show all the toy programs ive done 10+ years back, because i dont have them anymore
01.03.19 16:15:56<stoopkid> same pretty much, i have a publication related to database work so that helps but a relevant portfolio would definitely be better
01.03.19 16:16:09<stoopkid> ex. if we're doing websites/apps we should actually have a website/app
01.03.19 16:20:52<stoopkid> one way i figure we might (try to) go about this is we can try to find jobs building something for somebody's business that we also need for our business, and do them both at the same time
01.03.19 16:25:10<stoopkid> like what would be a proper portfolio for us: a website with a demonstration of our paid & open-source software work in states of completion & as many ways as possible to send money to us for things
01.03.19 16:27:31<editable-dog>https://www.upwork.com/job/Developer-needed-for-creating-online-tutoring-website_~01a1a2141647129cec/
01.03.19 16:27:52<editable-dog>im thinking if this guy accepted a vue-based solution, i might go for it
01.03.19 16:28:49<stoopkid> the specifications sound flexible enough heh
01.03.19 16:30:32<editable-dog>im quite enjoying vue and the novelty of learning it and learning js
01.03.19 16:31:47<editable-dog>so i figure if the guy was ok with it taking a month...
01.03.19 16:32:00<editable-dog>or less, if we'd both work on it
01.03.19 16:32:27<editable-dog>and a next similar job would be reasonably profitable
01.03.19 16:33:21<editable-dog>well, at least thats one vision of how things may go
01.03.19 16:35:35<stoopkid> if they don't have any constraints other than that it run in a browser and interact with a SQL or mongo db then i think we could knock something out with professional quality (even if not "fully featured") in a couple weeks if they're a good client, depending on what their "detailed sketches" actually look like
01.03.19 16:43:21<editable-dog>ok, if youre down for this one, youre gonna have to answer it, as its blocked for me
01.03.19 16:44:56<editable-dog>https://www.upwork.com/job/Php-sql-add-functionality_~017933cf627dbe9e83/
01.03.19 16:44:58<editable-dog>same this one
01.03.19 16:46:37<editable-dog>except im actually fairly confident with the php+mysql stack, so it would be just a matter of deciphering student spaghetti code and figuring out some payment api
01.03.19 17:05:38<editable-dog>yeah on a second thought this job sounds quite good
01.03.19 17:05:57<editable-dog>maybe except the client doesnt have any history
01.03.19 17:08:14<editable-dog>as on the R into Python, if you actually feel like studying the ML theory where necessary, then we can definitely try it
01.03.19 17:10:05<editable-dog>i just think it souunds a little bit too much like going through hell for not even twice as much $$$ as the php payment button/tab job
01.03.19 17:51:50<editable-dog>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/firmware-checking_~01e61e9157da65b3ef
01.03.19 17:52:00<editable-dog>i think you would enjoy this one, if they are serious
01.03.19 17:52:10<editable-dog>by being serious i mean having any idea what theyre asking for
01.03.19 17:53:36<editable-dog>i'd be down for working on it too ofc
01.03.19 17:53:57<editable-dog>anyway i think im done responding to everything i found interesting
01.03.19 17:54:12<editable-dog>6 jobs
01.03.19 17:54:34<editable-dog>i didnt reply to the firmware one
01.03.19 18:09:25<stoopkid> ok for the tutoring job, how long do you think for an initial proposal based on knowing nothing about it
01.03.19 18:11:35<editable-dog>what initial proposal?
01.03.19 18:13:01<stoopkid> one of the questions is "How long will this project take?"
01.03.19 18:13:54<editable-dog>oh
01.03.19 18:13:56<editable-dog>one month
01.03.19 18:17:35<stoopkid> would you say that's "less than 1 month" or "1 to 3 months"
01.03.19 18:21:30<editable-dog>idk, what do you think?
01.03.19 18:22:37<editable-dog>i guess 1 to 3 is safe bet
01.03.19 18:23:15<editable-dog>well, its Last viewed by client:  1 month ago
01.03.19 18:23:30<editable-dog>we probably dont even need to try
01.03.19 18:24:19<editable-dog>less than 5 proposals, do you think people thought its too little $$$?
01.03.19 18:27:40<editable-dog>i would say it would depend on the actual scope, that would only be visible from the specs/sketches
01.03.19 18:27:49<editable-dog>apparent
01.03.19 18:36:26<stoopkid> didn't notice the "last viewed" but maybe they'll check it at some point; so maybe we could set a baseline for what kind of scope we think would be reasonable for the price / timeframe in the question "Do you have suggestions to make this project run successfully?"
01.03.19 18:38:51<editable-dog>all i can say at this point is that we need to see their materials first
01.03.19 18:43:55<stoopkid> wrt whether people thought it was too little $, probably, especially relative to vaguely-defined specs in a non-standard domain, but i figure we have to assume that part of our job is to help the client come up with what is actually a realistic job for us that will actually realistically start achieving their purposes
01.03.19 18:44:35<stoopkid> ex. in this case for $1000 i figure the client should probably not be focused on whatever their fancy sketches are but instead focused on going from 0 -> users as fast as possible
01.03.19 19:15:23<editable-dog>maybe the  interexchange arbitrage bot isnt such a bad idea
01.03.19 19:23:43<stoopkid> i'm open to it
01.03.19 19:40:41<editable-dog>its more of your cuppa, so ill leave the answering to you
01.03.19 19:41:07<editable-dog>i registered on freelancer and im looking at some other sites now
01.03.19 19:41:46<editable-dog>but it seems that all that anyone wants is web, web, web
01.03.19 19:42:00<editable-dog>guess we have to get into it
01.03.19 19:44:02<stoopkid> for the tutoring one: https://pastebin.com/eprkMz33
01.03.19 19:45:28<editable-dog>holy shit, i found my cnc hdd
01.03.19 19:45:43<editable-dog>you wouldnt believe the amount of old hdds i had to go through to find it
01.03.19 19:46:00<editable-dog>ok checking
01.03.19 19:47:22<editable-dog>so, they say fixed price $1000 and you bid 1200? i thought fixed was like...fixed
01.03.19 19:49:45<editable-dog>very nice response
01.03.19 19:50:08<editable-dog>i wouldnt be able to write this
01.03.19 19:51:50<stoopkid> thanks, i hate writing fluff like this lol
01.03.19 19:53:48<stoopkid> yea i figured there's probably relatively little chance we'd actually fulfill this client's goals at $850 after upwork-tax and before regular taxes without going over budget / deadline, but $1000 after upwork tax i would feel relatively confident that we could deliver *something* that roughly meets specifications and can accommodate users
01.03.19 19:56:47<stoopkid> now what i don't know is how haggling works on upwork, or if you even can or if you're just stuck with the bid
01.03.19 19:57:03<stoopkid> ah i can change terms / withdraw proposal
01.03.19 19:59:29<stoopkid> so if they can only swing $1000 our initial bid gives us some room to start the discussion off with us talking them down on feature requirements
01.03.19 20:03:04<stoopkid> ah i think clients & freelancers are actually legally obligated not to circumvent upwork for some duration
01.03.19 20:04:33<editable-dog>https://www.scalablepath.com/
01.03.19 20:06:51<stoopkid> for php/mysql job what do you think about the $550 bid price and "less than 1 month" ?
01.03.19 20:07:20<editable-dog>ok, im sleeping in the chair, so, catch you tomorrow i guess
01.03.19 20:07:25<editable-dog>the payment thing?
01.03.19 20:07:32<stoopkid> yea
01.03.19 20:07:33<editable-dog>yeah sounds good
01.03.19 20:10:17<stoopkid> alright i'll probably be busy with some things tomorrow but i'll find some time in between to post some more applications
01.03.19 20:33:22<stoopkid> https://pastebin.com/75ZvLcWw
01.03.19 20:36:40<stoopkid> crypto trading bot was 2 months ago, not sure, i guess we can assume we have some time to mull that one over a bit
01.03.19 20:38:30<stoopkid> especially since short answer to the 1 question they ask is "no, we don't" so i think we'd have to really consider how close our current experience is to actually being able to do that, although the price is certainly right (assuming a scope limited to reason ofc)
01.03.19 20:39:48<stoopkid> like if they just have some specific given formulas they want us to apply, sure
01.03.19 20:40:55<stoopkid> if they want us to be like... creative with machine-learning, that might be out of scope for what we could currently take on
01.03.19 20:41:10<stoopkid> even with the $7k
01.03.19 20:45:58<stoopkid> that on top of the economics on top of the meat of the integrations? we'd probably be at least $1k worth of labor in before we even really got a handle on what was required / whether or not we could even do it
01.03.19 20:50:28<stoopkid> wrt getting in on the web craze, i don't really have an issue with it, the web stack isn't really difficult it's just that the jobs tend to be on the boring side and it's often as much a creative design gig as it is an actual sw development gig, plus making a portfolio and etc etc..
01.03.19 20:58:51<stoopkid> but i figure that's something we already have to do anyway, like we also need a website, which needs creative design etc..
01.03.19 21:02:01<stoopkid> also i figure with freelancing we don't necessarily have like... job stability around any specific type of thing, and every business is gonna have some crazy different scenario than the last one so i figure we can't really look at "what it is we do" as some specific type of software work or w/e it has to more along the lines of "we're in business to help businesses do business better"
01.03.19 21:19:57<stoopkid> here's probably a good way to address the issue of "vague client specs", instead of asking the client what specifically they want out of their vague specs, we present our own conception of what approaching a project like this means, like a birds-eye break-down of the component parts of projects similar to what they describe, and what each component represents in terms of a development milestone, and let them use that
                 <stoopkid> as a concrete basis for figuring out how they want to allocate their time
01.03.19 21:21:05<stoopkid> i figure it's probably not the best practice to bid up from their price but rather break it down into components and show what options of components can actually be done for the stated price, along with what it would cost for the rest
01.03.19 21:22:19<stoopkid> it's maybe a more polite way to accomplish the goal of bidding up and starting the process of talking them down on features
01.03.19 21:25:04<stoopkid> so ex. when they say "i want a website", we already know the general idea of what goes into a website, from hosting, to domain registration, to graphic design, to front-end dev, to back-end dev, to databases, to security, to payment processing, to etc...
01.03.19 21:28:51<stoopkid> we can do all of that, but always subject to the iron triangle
01.03.19 21:42:19<stoopkid> regarding the payment processing ones, we might want to be careful about those before we're sure we're personally protected from liability
01.03.19 21:44:53<stoopkid> https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/t/1/details/~0160f9525e8e921b97/?q=sql&sort=recency&user_location_match=2
01.03.19 21:47:09<stoopkid> "We have a series of datasets from different places, each in CSV form and need to integrate them into a single, merged database, which will require some scrubbing and integration work. We have built the initial Ontology frameworks and have additional data series to add. "
01.03.19 21:47:22<stoopkid> for $10k yea i think this sounds approachable
01.03.19 22:35:27<stoopkid> i figure for fixed-price projects we don't wanna do upwork's "per milestone" cause it's a bit rigid on what kind of initial expectations that sets for the client, but rather just do "per project", at their stated price, and then use the cover letter & attachments to elaborate on what we can provide for them at various prices & time-frames

02.03.19 02:14:40<editable-dog>yo
02.03.19 02:21:39<editable-dog>the haasbot thing also already has two hires
02.03.19 02:21:47<editable-dog>and its not us afaict
02.03.19 02:22:22<editable-dog>but theyre a well-rated client, so we might as give it a try
02.03.19 02:23:26<editable-dog>i cant see the questions they ask in the proposal form from here though
02.03.19 02:23:59<editable-dog>neither when logged out
02.03.19 02:30:37<editable-dog>>instead of asking the client what specifically they want out of their vague specs, we present
02.03.19 02:30:43<editable-dog>yeah sounds great
02.03.19 02:31:13<editable-dog>just first need to have one similar project under belt, then it will be easy
02.03.19 02:33:18<editable-dog>yeah i always find the "milestones" form offputting, like, i do want to do it by milestones, but the clients never even provide in the posting whatever specs they already have, so how can we set milestones at this time
02.03.19 02:36:02<editable-dog>the ETL sounds good, but What’s your preferred method of integration across multiple, similar datasets.
02.03.19 02:36:14<editable-dog>idk, show me the datasets
02.03.19 02:41:27<editable-dog>ive looked at http://openrefine.org/ once, it seemed nice
02.03.19 02:41:59<editable-dog>but my preferred method is probably python scripts
02.03.19 02:46:13<editable-dog>i guess if its Client's budget: $10,000.00 USD
02.03.19 02:46:27<editable-dog>and What is the full amount you'd like to bid for this job?
02.03.19 02:46:38<editable-dog>people are actually expected to bid lower prices
02.03.19 02:47:40<editable-dog>how can they bid on a price when they havent seen any of the work actually involved or the scope
02.03.19 02:55:08<editable-dog>$10,000.00
02.03.19 02:55:13<editable-dog>We are a two-man team based in USA and Europe, with experience in both computer science research and practical software development. We have experience working with both linked data technologies, as well as relational databases. We can work on a per-day or fixed price basis.
                 <editable-dog>What’s your preferred method of integration across multiple, similar datasets.
02.03.19 02:55:14<editable-dog>Python scripting
02.03.19 03:17:35<editable-dog>laravel...i would be picking it up, you'd be picking up even php...so ,  There is no time to learn on the job.  ..
02.03.19 03:55:05<editable-dog>not sure about the vue job...guess i gotta really learn vue first
02.03.19 03:55:12<editable-dog>theres quite a lot to it
02.03.19 08:46:46<editable-dog>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2-3-4-player-games/id1269516792?mt=8
02.03.19 08:46:50<editable-dog>awesome
02.03.19 08:47:17<editable-dog>we could do something like that for the laser thing
02.03.19 08:47:27<editable-dog>we could also propose a game with bitcoin theme
02.03.19 08:49:22<editable-dog>or one that gives you the option to store your highscore in bitcoin
02.03.19 09:51:41<stoopkid> rather than "Python scripting" maybe something more like "Schema crosswalks and object-relational mapping in Python"
02.03.19 09:55:02<stoopkid> heh, online tutoring job closed
02.03.19 10:04:28<stoopkid> i've worked with PHP before i wouldn't be too worried about it, it would be mostly a matter of getting up to speed on laravel
02.03.19 10:06:36<stoopkid> though if there's actually "no time to learn on the job" maybe not the right job for that
02.03.19 10:11:16<editable-dog>cool
02.03.19 10:14:50<editable-dog>so, idk if this is the right thing to do now, but i went back to my jsonld issue, and im trying to go through the library's code to understand whats going on
02.03.19 10:15:07<editable-dog>i met some funky new js syntaxes in the proces, so im trying to figure those out now
02.03.19 10:46:11<editable-dog>what do you think about those games? should i try to update the proposal?

02.03.19 14:07:56<stoopkid> id be open to that do you have any specific game proposals though?
02.03.19 14:08:28<stoopkid> probably wouldnt anything too much beyond the complexity of say.. pong or w/e
02.03.19 14:39:42<editable-dog>lets say a simple 2d car racing game
02.03.19 14:42:13<editable-dog>or a simple 3d first person shooter
02.03.19 14:43:44<editable-dog>yeah actually i think about this once in a while, i used to write various game-like things and graphical toys, and it was a lot of fun
02.03.19 14:44:02<editable-dog>i think that it would make me enjoy programming more again
02.03.19 15:19:56<stoopkid> hm how would you relate the game to btc tho?
02.03.19 15:37:26<editable-dog>i suppose i wouldnt try to relate car racing to btc
02.03.19 15:37:57<editable-dog>one job was games, one job was btc stuff

02.03.19 16:11:11<editable-dog>meh, finally progress with jsonld

02.03.19 18:52:08<stoopkid> 10-15 proposals within 2 hours
02.03.19 23:47:08<stoopkid> been studying react, angular & vue a bit
02.03.19 23:47:51<stoopkid> seems like they need to just give up w/ HTML and CSS already and just make a browser that runs by having js directly control the rendering tree
03.03.19 02:22:08<editable-dog>im not sure if making everything go through js fixes much
03.03.19 02:22:16<editable-dog>did you reply to those two?
03.03.19 02:22:50<editable-dog>its quite a difference between scopes for $500 hehe
03.03.19 08:29:38<stoopkid> didn't reply yet wanted to see what you thought about it
03.03.19 10:12:16<editable-dog>well the scraping one definitely seems worth replying to
03.03.19 10:12:40<editable-dog>but i doubt we have any chance there with 0 reputation
03.03.19 10:15:59<stoopkid> same, unfortunately
03.03.19 10:21:05<editable-dog>i'll try to browse freelancer when i get home
03.03.19 10:22:23<stoopkid> i'm looking at fiverr too
03.03.19 10:23:09<stoopkid> i guess we might have to bite the bullet and take some unprofitable jobs to gain some initial rep
03.03.19 10:24:48<stoopkid> i assume we could hold out and "eventually" get a couple initial jobs at the right price but i think the faster we can get to having *any* job the better
03.03.19 10:25:24<stoopkid> and i guess if there's any time to do that, it would be now
03.03.19 10:29:01<stoopkid> have you worked with any python web-scraping frameworks yet?
03.03.19 10:29:45<stoopkid> also i looked at the univar github issues but i didn't see any, did you get them all or am i looking in the wrong place?
03.03.19 10:46:41<stoopkid> https://www.freelancer.com/projects/graphic-design/need-another-website/?w=f
03.03.19 10:47:25<stoopkid> i figure we can probably assume that the range of bids on upwork is probably similar to the range of bids on freelancer
03.03.19 11:04:17<stoopkid> people seem to be recommending BeautifulSoup for python web-scraping
03.03.19 12:16:26<editable-dog>wrong place, https://github.com/koo5/AutoNomic-pyco/issues
03.03.19 12:16:40<editable-dog>i kinda didnt finish the migration
03.03.19 12:17:05<editable-dog>from univar, that is
03.03.19 12:17:49<editable-dog>ive used BeautifulSoup once, which is a scraping library
03.03.19 12:17:55<editable-dog>just one script
03.03.19 12:19:37<editable-dog>i wouldnt quite know where to start nowadays
03.03.19 12:20:00<editable-dog>he wants a cms? where..
03.03.19 12:21:22<editable-dog>i was figuring i'd start writing down a past projects page. cant hurt, right?
03.03.19 13:05:45<editable-dog>i accidentally two freelancer profiles
03.03.19 15:14:11<editable-dog>pondering https://www.freelancer.com/projects/python/code-sender/?w=f
03.03.19 15:14:58<editable-dog>i actually do know a bit about gcode and the tools
03.03.19 15:15:11<editable-dog>but..we'd have to come up with a proposal of what can be done for this little money
03.03.19 15:15:43<editable-dog>anyway keep an eye out for this cnc stuff
03.03.19 15:32:23<editable-dog>https://github.com/koo5/destroy_all_capitalist_e-ink
03.03.19 15:32:44<editable-dog>probably not good fit for portfolio
03.03.19 15:33:08<editable-dog>could probably get banned from github for this lol
03.03.19 17:35:58<editable-dog>okay, just had a chat with some guy and was fixing his code, while he was awarding the project to someone else, and stopped writing
03.03.19 17:36:12<editable-dog>i sent him the fixed code anyway, why not lol
03.03.19 17:36:37<editable-dog>i quite like the jobs on freelancer, answering to a few more
03.03.19 17:37:26<editable-dog>the site just seems to live off freelancers taking tests for $5 and "sponsoring" bids for $5 and i imagine its similar on the client side
03.03.19 17:38:09<editable-dog>https://www.freelancer.com/projects/php/python-language-expert-needed/?w=f#placebid
03.03.19 17:38:21<editable-dog>im wondering if everyone sees the text i wrote in the bid there?

03.03.19 18:50:27<editable-dog>well, still communicating with the second guy

04.03.19 07:12:12<stoopkid> how much would you charge for a client-side-only web page from a template?
04.03.19 07:16:13<stoopkid> or rather, how cheaply do you think we could reasonably do a simple page from a template

04.03.19 08:20:33<stoopkid> might be an easier thing to break into than web design
04.03.19 08:40:43<stoopkid> so, for front-end work the standards seem to be react, angular and vue, and all of these seem pretty approachable, so i don't think front-end dev would be any problem for us we're probably gonna have more trouble with graphic design
04.03.19 08:43:17<stoopkid> mainly cause there's high expectations of conforming to a very specific standard that i don't think either of us have spent a lot of time studying for its own sake
04.03.19 08:45:22<stoopkid> like knowing how to take some geometry specs and create an invoice document out of that as opposed to already knowing what the "proper" geometry of an invoice is supposed to be

04.03.19 09:05:23<sirccloud> I wouldnt bid the lowest
04.03.19 09:05:52<sirccloud> Lets stand out lol
04.03.19 09:06:41<sirccloud> Or as you think
04.03.19 09:06:52<sirccloud> Wait whats the script in
04.03.19 09:06:59<stoopkid> $500 would also stand out lol
04.03.19 09:07:24<stoopkid> html, js, php, looks like
04.03.19 09:14:34<sirccloud> I think theres no script
04.03.19 09:14:45<sirccloud> Its probably againsr their tos even
04.03.19 09:15:03<sirccloud> I would propose an android app
04.03.19 09:16:06<sirccloud>  / mobile app
04.03.19 09:16:59<stoopkid> yea i'm still not exactly sure what an instagram requests acceptor script is or what you're allowed to do with their API
04.03.19 09:21:31<sirccloud> Id build a little android demon that sends a signal on new requests and handles an accept signal
04.03.19 09:22:42<sirccloud> Then the automation itself could be handled with AutomateIT, without breakingToS
04.03.19 09:24:13<stoopkid> so what exactly is the ToS issue? could we include this in the cover-letter?
04.03.19 09:29:24<stoopkid> side-note: wondering about using nodejs as a webscraper since it's already a js interpreter
04.03.19 09:37:43<stoopkid> ah nice, that's what puppeteer's for
04.03.19 09:41:52<stoopkid> https://www.freelancer.com/projects/javascript/NodeJS-Puppeteer-scraper-for-entire/?w=f
04.03.19 09:46:05<stoopkid> maybe eventually we can make ourselves a webscraper to find us jobs lol
04.03.19 09:49:30<stoopkid> wanna see if you like any of these portfolio designs? https://onextrapixel.com/60-clean-and-simple-examples-of-portfolio-design/
04.03.19 09:50:47<stoopkid> not necessarily just for our own portfolio but also keep an eye out for designs you'd want to showcase / use as templates
04.03.19 09:54:43<stoopkid> i'm thinking when we design our portfolio we should maybe try to make the process be basically acting out the actual process we would go through w/ a client, i.e. more or less the same design documentation to go along w/ the site itself
04.03.19 09:55:49<stoopkid> more ideally, we could use that design documentation as a basic outline of the site itself
04.03.19 10:01:27<stoopkid> so like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#Phases
04.03.19 10:04:15<stoopkid> each phase basically a different page, page layout roughly corresponding to the actual documentation we would provide to the client in that phase, so it's like "here, you can see more or less exactly what methodology we're going to apply to your project"
04.03.19 10:38:07<stoopkid> https://recursivelyrecursive.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/cat.jpg
04.03.19 10:41:04<stoopkid> could be an interesting thing to build on the portfolio site, i was thinking about having something to showcase how we can make the display change responsively according to display size & resolution, but we could also make it start out as a replica of the user's current display and have it look like an infinite-repeating image that you can scroll in/out of
04.03.19 11:02:20<stoopkid> well, i've got the basics of vue down so now i think it's mostly a matter of getting from basics to "here's a site in vue"
04.03.19 11:08:47<stoopkid> i guess it's less a matter of vue or w/e front-end and more a matter of knowing what page layout/geometry/styling to be aiming for in the first place
04.03.19 11:14:12<sirccloud> Yeah headless browser defimitely has advamtages over just parsing html
04.03.19 11:14:33<sirccloud> Their ToS prohibit using their api in automated fashion
04.03.19 11:15:07<sirccloud> Well i definitely wanted to make a script to fetch me RSS feeds from upwork..
04.03.19 11:15:50<stoopkid> so basically if a user clicks a button that uses their API, that's ok, but having a machine click the button is not?
04.03.19 11:19:46<stoopkid> seems like it might still apply to using AutomateIT to accomplish that?
04.03.19 11:31:56<sirccloud> Well, but we wont be the ones making automateIT click it
04.03.19 12:25:51<stoopkid> https://coolors.co
04.03.19 12:34:35<sirccloud> Meh, web design people make me want to puke
04.03.19 12:35:09<sirccloud> "Design is how it works"? I dont think so
04.03.19 12:35:17<stoopkid> lol
04.03.19 12:37:28<stoopkid> where did you see that
04.03.19 12:40:24<sirccloud> Olly Sorsby
04.03.19 12:40:37<sirccloud> In the portfolio page
04.03.19 12:40:50<stoopkid> ah
04.03.19 12:44:22<stoopkid> yea
04.03.19 12:45:10<stoopkid> this stuff all looks nice as far as graphic design and maybe there's some elements like color scheme & typography we can get out of it but i hate sites like this that are pretty much just a graphic design and not actually a website
04.03.19 14:01:25<stoopkid> so i think on pretty much any code we do we need some kind of watermarking along with some way to demonstrate the product w/o revealing the source code
04.03.19 14:17:29<stoopkid> https://www.javascriptobfuscator.com/
04.03.19 14:18:34<stoopkid> maybe instead of "Design is how it works" we could have "Designed to work"
04.03.19 14:19:10<stoopkid> then again it doesn't say much, hypothetically all designs should be designed to work lol
04.03.19 14:47:09<sirccloud> Yeah obfuscator sounds like a great way to do previews
04.03.19 14:49:14<sirccloud> Translation service: English to binary and back. For You.
04.03.19 14:50:16<sirccloud> Something raw like that, what we are about, not what the fluffies are about
04.03.19 14:50:29<sirccloud> Acessibility and usability first
04.03.19 14:50:41<stoopkid> works for me
04.03.19 14:53:36<stoopkid> now we just need a good way to communicate that to clients through page layout
04.03.19 15:10:05<stoopkid> now.. to try to avoid as much as possible having to fiddle with specific styling elements, any graphic design we do we should probably design as a template w/ just a couple options for configurability (assuming they aren't already provided for in the CMS), color schemes & fonts probably being the #1
04.03.19 15:20:19<stoopkid> so, how much do you think you would charge for a simple static site, following some standard layout, where all we were doing was figuring out how to fit the client's text/image content and styling into the layout without any dynamically configured content, possibly not even any js, no database / server-side processing, and no customized graphic design
04.03.19 15:23:38<stoopkid> just to kinda get a baseline
04.03.19 15:30:05<stoopkid> it's kinda weird because a job that simple could itself be automated without much further effort than the job itself, and then we're looking at an entirely different thing from a business perspective
04.03.19 15:30:52<editable-dog>strstrstrs
04.03.19 15:34:15<editable-dog>idk really, i haven't done this for 20 years

04.03.19 16:06:21<editable-dog>i should probably work on the pyco visualization a bit, before i forget where i left off
04.03.19 16:07:42<editable-dog>well the idea with static sites should be that you maybe have your content in some database with a nice administration ui, or in plain files
04.03.19 16:07:52<editable-dog>then you just run a generator over it
04.03.19 16:08:44<editable-dog>and you download/buy some design from somewhere and you should be done

05.03.19 00:37:32<stoopkid> so im taking a russian language class to fulfill the "diversity" requirement for my degree, do you happen to have the equivalent of ы in czech? i'm trying to understand what this sound actually .. "is".. lol
05.03.19 00:40:48<stoopkid> it's like, not quite "wi" as in "we"/"win" or somewhere in between, not quite "ye" as in "boy"
05.03.19 00:41:22<stoopkid> best i can understand it it's like trying to say "ee" while trying to gulp at the same time, if that makes sense

05.03.19 05:04:24<sirccloud> I think i always attributed this sound to russian people just being rough lol
05.03.19 05:05:14<sirccloud> I  czech y and i is the same sound, so a huge part of czech classess is dedicated to the rules of what to write where

05.03.19 14:24:45<stoopkid> seems like it's basically just a buzzword for storing content data in a presentation-independent format, but i may be missing some of the finer details implied by the term
05.03.19 14:41:32<stoopkid> probably one trend is gonna be CMS tools that can work offline / asynchronously so i figure the git-backed headless CMS are gonna have some popularity, especially since they're already integrated w/ de facto standard version control system
05.03.19 14:42:59<stoopkid> plus their structure is basically just file-system & files, basically at the technical level that content developers can manage, not like a DBMS or w/e
05.03.19 14:46:15<stoopkid> so the content developers' job should basically just be producing content and appropriately labeling the content w/ labels that are semantically relevant to what the content actually semantically represents to their business or to the user or w/e, ex. instead of "this is a div with a span and etc.." just "this is a tweet"
05.03.19 14:49:11<stoopkid> another benefit w/ the file-system is ofc that it's already basically equipped to handle whatever arbitrary kind of data the user might put in it, just a directory of arbitrary files and then let the presentation stack figure out what to do w/ it
05.03.19 14:53:28<stoopkid> so then integration w/ a particular front-end design should just be a matter of a schema crosswalk mapping their semantic elements to display elements
05.03.19 14:57:42<stoopkid> we/ should probably get on some diagram-drawing site or something and when we're looking at a serious gig try to sketch out our initial impressions of what the project might look like
05.03.19 15:00:00<stoopkid> i'm also thinking a trend w/ the headless CMS is we're gonna eventually see it expand beyond web and start becoming just a buzzword describing a standard way of integrating techies w/ fluffies in any project
05.03.19 15:22:07<editable-dog>hmm, ive been pronouncing the word appear wrong all this time
05.03.19 15:22:43<editable-dog>hehe
05.03.19 15:22:57<editable-dog>yeah your analysis sounds about right
05.03.19 15:24:13<editable-dog>i think though, it was written somewhere on GraphCMS website, that they are right, that git isnt actually how users want to manage their content
05.03.19 15:24:27<editable-dog>its a programmer thing
05.03.19 15:24:59<editable-dog>so, administration ui is needed, hence "decoupled" cms i suppose
05.03.19 15:26:42<editable-dog>https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/
05.03.19 15:27:21<editable-dog>https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/headless-cms/
05.03.19 15:27:32<editable-dog>i feel like this one might be worth learneng
05.03.19 15:27:41<editable-dog>if we want to get into this kind of business
05.03.19 15:28:16<editable-dog>im still randomly answering ads on freelancer, upwork and now also workana
05.03.19 15:28:45<editable-dog>building up profiles and stuff
05.03.19 15:39:20<editable-dog>nice, theres actually something like gatsby for vue
05.03.19 15:46:19<stoopkid> vuepress?
05.03.19 15:55:40<editable-dog>https://gridsome.org/
05.03.19 17:38:48<stoopkid> so, we should probably pick some stack to test and try implementing our portfolio site
05.03.19 17:39:45<stoopkid> before we do that though we should probably get in some collaborative diagram editor and lay out the high-level design
05.03.19 17:42:11<stoopkid> (the content management & delivery strategy, not the site outline.. but also that)
05.03.19 17:48:23<stoopkid> gridsome/graphql looks interesting, we'd need to pick some headless CMS to go w/ it and some example content to try to build
05.03.19 18:20:24<editable-dog>ok, i suppose an architecture diagram makes sense in this case, we can also use it as content for the site
05.03.19 18:22:16<editable-dog>yeah just give me some more time for more research/trying out
05.03.19 18:33:27<stoopkid> well we might want to make a diagram of what frameworks even fit together / how, and then we'd have documentation of the research that might help us pick out specific strategies easier by just selecting them out the diagram
05.03.19 18:50:54<stoopkid> i'm thinking that w/ stuff like git-backed headless CMS we're probably gonna see it shift away from the paradigm of storing the entire site in git and into something more like using git to store a history of (potentially undoable) content developer/manager actions relative to a set of resources, since the git paradigm doesn't really scale to stuff like ex. a large database
05.03.19 19:13:18<editable-dog>well, we definitely should be taking notes from this research
05.03.19 19:14:15<editable-dog>like, gatsby is built on react
05.03.19 19:14:45<editable-dog>gridsome and vuepress on js
05.03.19 19:14:58<editable-dog>vuepress is created by vue author
05.03.19 19:15:27<editable-dog>vuepress is mainly for docs, and it still doesnt even have its own docs in itself
05.03.19 19:15:48<editable-dog>gridsome is general purpose
05.03.19 19:18:44<editable-dog>now it just a matter of finishing the cnl and making a search box:p
05.03.19 19:19:38<editable-dog>or just organizing and tagging things a bit and making a searchbox
05.03.19 19:20:15<editable-dog>metalsmith is weird
05.03.19 20:08:07<editable-dog>the rabbit hole goes on and on..
05.03.19 20:12:42<editable-dog>funilly enough, while i feel very comfortable with PHP, not only have i never used any frameworks in it, i also dont have any project in it to show, and since yo usay you know it too, we might want to think about showcasing it somehow
05.03.19 20:13:43<editable-dog>it actually has some nice frameworks nowadays, i hear
05.03.19 20:14:05<editable-dog>but then you run into: how do i make a rest api, theres not a single good library for it, lol
05.03.19 20:14:19<editable-dog>or something like that
05.03.19 20:23:41<stoopkid> sure, i figured we'd maybe get to that by starting w/ some light-weight static site just to get a basic feel for putting a whole site together and then add in server-side stuff in another iteration
05.03.19 21:38:40<stoopkid> megan said she can potentially help out with custom graphic design as well
05.03.19 21:41:34<stoopkid> she might also be open to content-writing, depending on the job (would kind of go hand-in-hand w/ the graphic design in a lot of cases)
05.03.19 21:48:47<stoopkid> kind of outside of "what we do" but that might help round out our service a bit, she can basically help us out w/ those fluffier aspects that we don't want to be having to deal with but probably can't assume we can avoid if we're gonna be living off freelancing
05.03.19 22:00:19<stoopkid> another thing we might want to look into is mapping tools, it wasn't that complicated to do google maps APIs & cesiumJS etc.. back when we were working on that, and that's a bit higher-value job and would probably be a good thing to showcase
05.03.19 22:32:48<stoopkid> something else i think we're probably gonna want to work on, which we've discussed some before: automated build/deployment of a collaborative dev environment
05.03.19 22:42:50<stoopkid> i'm thinking that after we get a light-weight static portfolio site and before we get into server-side stuff we should spend some time collecting APIs that we can use in fully client-side applications
05.03.19 23:01:19<stoopkid> here's basically my general idea for how i want to approach this i wanna know if you're on more or less the same page or if you'd take a different approach so that we can make sure we're putting our efforts into the same direction and that it's the right direction for us:
05.03.19 23:03:53<stoopkid> so, there's a wide range of work out there from hardcore down-to-the-bits hacking & problem-solving (what we maybe hypothetically want to be doing, for the right price & timeframe) to pure business fluff content-writing graphic design SEO etc.. (what we generally hate doing)
05.03.19 23:06:26<stoopkid> i'm thinking if we're gonna pursue this freelancing thing i would maybe want to start as close to the latter as possible
05.03.19 23:14:10<stoopkid> i guess starting out i want to be more focused on business than code, if that makes sense?
05.03.19 23:21:09<stoopkid> like i guess 6 months from now when we're in the middle of some major coding disaster project that was seriously underfunded and we're struggling to find other work i don't want to still be lacking general business fundamentals like portfolio, marketing ourselves (even to lowest common denominator fluff if that's what's necessary), etc.. that we neglected due to pursuing some particular interesting job (ex. like what
05.03.19 23:21:10<stoopkid> we did w/ autonomic after we had previously talked about still pursuing freelancing etc..)
05.03.19 23:27:38<stoopkid> like i don't want much serious coding to be too much of a distraction right now while we're trying to do our own business fluffing (not to mention also still getting our general bearings in the modern web ecosystem) and i don't want lack of business fluffing & business planning to be a distraction later when we actually do have some major coding disaster
05.03.19 23:31:33<stoopkid> not that we should necessarily avoid the more interesting/challenging custom jobs or that we should intentionally seek out actual fluff like content-writing and graphic design, but, say for example we're trying to market ourselves for CRM/ERP work
05.03.19 23:45:18<stoopkid> also because, at least under our current business model, i figure we're not in business for software we're in business for business
05.03.19 23:51:13<stoopkid> what are our goals? #1 is obviously money, that's what's dragging us into thinking about doing random mundane freelancing jobs in the first place instead of working on our own creative endeavors
05.03.19 23:54:07<stoopkid> #2 i figure is professional/personal independence within the parameters of cautiously assuming we can't/shouldn't necessarily wait around for any of our own creative golden eggs to hatch before we start independently bringing in income
05.03.19 23:57:03<stoopkid> and #3 i would say is to *eventually* be working on the exact kind of things we want to be working on, while maintaining the financial security & independence from #1 and #2
05.03.19 23:58:23<stoopkid> (ofc lemme know if you'd disagree w/ that selection/order)
06.03.19 00:03:12<stoopkid> obv money being #1 probably isn't really how either of us really feel "on the inside" or w/e, but, i also think we can't really afford to prioritize it differently?
06.03.19 00:05:55<stoopkid> like our fundamental objective here is to solve "the money problem" so that we can even begin working on #2 and #3
06.03.19 00:25:02<stoopkid> like idk, that's basically what that means to me in prioritizing money as #1, not like we'd sacrifice our ethics for money or like we're out to be the richest or anything like that ofc but i want to make the problem go away without sacrificing #2 and #3
06.03.19 00:29:54<stoopkid> there's plenty of interesting pure coding, game dev, etc.. work out there but i guess that to me isn't (in and of itself) what represents financial security, what represents financial security to me is financial security (i.e. the study & implementation thereof)
06.03.19 00:32:59<stoopkid> not to mention that in essentially all cases the pure coding, game dev, reasoner dev, whatever etc.. is simply a function of somebody else's business process where their entire reason for existence let alone commissioning work on this particular code is to also solve their own financial security problem
06.03.19 00:37:22<stoopkid> how are we currently trying to get the $? via upwork etc.. where we can see 99% of jobs are somebody else has latched onto some demand and is trying to get somebody to help streamline the interface between their supply & that demand

06.03.19 00:41:53<stoopkid> the way i look at that business model is that for probably any high-valued job (one where we're in charge of implementing any significant component of their operations), we're basically not just "here implement this thing according to this spec", we're basically taking over & automating some entire division of business for them, whether we're looking at it that way or not
06.03.19 01:04:44<stoopkid> i guess being confronted with the kinda staggering challenges involved with actually trying to seriously start doing business as independent professionals has given me some more respect for all these potential clients' attempts at doing their own business, however fluffy they might be
06.03.19 01:13:42<stoopkid> so consider ex. CRM/ERP work
06.03.19 01:20:26<stoopkid> our objective is to tap into the flow of money, this business commissioning the work is a source of money to us, where's that money coming from? it's all flowing through that CRM/ERP we build
06.03.19 01:24:21<stoopkid> also consider work on ex. microcontrollers, arduinos or w/e
06.03.19 01:26:24<stoopkid> we could implement some software for an arduino
06.03.19 01:27:41<stoopkid> if we got the hang of it we might think we could reasonably create an actual electronic product, or at least a prototype of one
06.03.19 01:28:37<stoopkid> we were looking at a laser light-show thing
06.03.19 01:33:01<stoopkid> we've both got some experience developing control systems software, if we got the hang of it we might think we could reasonably provide the automation for a factory
06.03.19 01:34:14<stoopkid> the factory commissioning the work is a source of money to us.. where's that money coming from?
06.03.19 01:36:16<stoopkid> if we were to provide the automation for a factory, on business-side, industrial-side or both, how far of a distance is that business-wise from actually "taking over operations" of the factory?
06.03.19 01:45:15<stoopkid> this might sound like i'm talking about pie-in-the-sky stuff like we're just figuring out how to sell static fluff sites on upwork and now i'm talking about taking over operations of factories, but it's more a matter of long-term goal/strategy/mindset
06.03.19 01:48:53<stoopkid> like we're freelancers scraping by for random small-bid work right now, but what are we 10, 20, 30, .. 100 years from now
06.03.19 01:56:55<stoopkid> if we were to design the CRM/ERP for a bank (meaning assess their business needs and implement a solution that runs their business better), how far is that, from a technical perspective, from taking over technical/general directorship of the bank?
06.03.19 01:59:28<stoopkid> so let's say 10, 20, 30 years from now etc.. we were actually in that position of actually taking over / starting some bank
06.03.19 02:03:59<stoopkid> imagine those future selves had to go back to random freelancing work again and magically this "own a bank" job appears on the freelancing site, and they're just the right people for the job, due to decades of experience in CRM/ERP/BI/PR/HR/SEO/security and yada yada yada
06.03.19 02:04:42<stoopkid> obv those future selves should take that job
06.03.19 02:10:12<stoopkid> so if those future selves should take that job, our current selves should hypothetically take that job if it were to actually be available, only problem (aside from that this is a completely unrealistic scenario exaggerated for effect) is that we're not equipped to actually perform the business functions
06.03.19 02:28:17<stoopkid> obv owning the bank is more financial security than just doing a one-time job dev-ing the bank's CMS/CRM/ERP/etc..
06.03.19 02:29:36<stoopkid> so, that's all completely exaggerated just to make sure the mindset is clear, but what does this matter to us in concrete terms now or 10, 20, 30, .. 100 years from now
06.03.19 02:33:51<stoopkid> consider rather than pie-in-the-sky bank/factory, instead <insert arbitrary profitable business venture that we happen to equipped to handle at whatever point in time>..
06.03.19 02:41:47<stoopkid> web hosting service? sure why not; cloud-hosting service? sure why not; automated crypto-trading service? sure why not..
06.03.19 02:50:11<stoopkid> these look a lot more reasonable but long-run where is the boundary on this? there isn't one, risk is unlimited over the long-run so long-run there shouldn't be any limit to financial/personal security precautions either
06.03.19 02:53:14<stoopkid> from a freelancing perspective it seems like the answer to "can my business do it" needs to always be tending towards "yes", in the long run
06.03.19 02:57:47<stoopkid> imagining what our future selves are doing, looking for some source of $ cause they actually need to make it happen because now they've got wives & kids & "livelihoods" or whatever and being equipped to handle <insert arbitrary profitable venture>, there's not a situation i would think where we'd think our future selves shouldn't "acquire that business and run it profitably" ?
06.03.19 03:22:49<stoopkid> so this still seems somewhat unreasonable (and also kind of greedy maybe?) to expect out of just the two of us ofc but now consider in the context of working with a team of 10 more people, or with a network of 100, etc.. with ethical business operations in whatever venture, structured as some kind of workers/consumers cooperative etc..
06.03.19 05:41:15<editable-dog>i think ill just look into this Ionic thing a bit, then go back to gridless. Gridless lets us make a markdown-files based site first, then add other sources when needed
06.03.19 05:47:29<editable-dog>so, one maybe not so obvious aspect of my general idea about this whole freelancing thing is that im ok if this ends up being a long run
06.03.19 05:48:41<editable-dog>in the unlikely event that i stumble into another part-time job of my dreams, for example
06.03.19 05:49:17<editable-dog>also, if i wanted to go a bit on the non-lubed side (which i dont want to), i still got about a year worth of savings
06.03.19 05:51:09<editable-dog>i figure ill just continue trying to get any gig we can, but i suppose nobody is gonna hire us for anything big anyway
06.03.19 05:53:35<editable-dog>im in the middle of my fourth negotiation on freelancer hehe
06.03.19 05:54:28<editable-dog>anyway, except the exceptions i stated, i agree with the business-first approach
06.03.19 05:55:16<editable-dog>especially as long as it also means catching up with webdev and maybe mobile dev
06.03.19 05:56:05<editable-dog>ive been ignoring this for so long, and i guess the time has come that this field has matured a bit, and ive been surpressing the feeling of inadequacy about this for very long now
06.03.19 05:57:13<editable-dog>will continue later, gotta dig into this guy's code..
06.03.19 07:41:28<editable-dog>wrt golden eggs..i still feel strongly about my cnl/ui ideas...if theyre best carried out within the tau framework is a question. I do feel it at least gives it some story wrt future expansion into a real programming language, which would be a huge plus. But i end up working mostly on tau alone, instead of getting to some mvp
06.03.19 07:48:01<stoopkid> i like your cnl/ui ideas & also some of the math / verification ideas i've been working on, among other ideas we've had, but the question for me there isn't do we think those ideas can be successful but rather when will they be successful & what does that success look like as far as income & longer-term financial security
06.03.19 07:49:04<stoopkid> especially seeing as how if anything we seem to be generally inclined to give away our work for free
06.03.19 07:55:32<stoopkid> like i still wouldn't really want to go into some kind of proprietary software product business-model, but then we need some other kind of business model
06.03.19 07:59:53<stoopkid> probably also wouldn't want to ex. get commissioned to basically dev & sell those ideas to somebody else who's just gonna run on the proprietary model cause then ofc we could've just done that ourselves
06.03.19 08:02:07<stoopkid> like i sort of want to keep a clear separation between "these are our personal projects" and "this is our business model" unless we're specifically intending to orient the business model around one of those projects
06.03.19 08:05:55<stoopkid> so, you feel strongly about your cnl/ui ideas, but what does that mean for you in terms of short-term / long-term business model
06.03.19 08:14:15<stoopkid> iow, do you feel strongly that they would be beneficial to the world, or do you feel strongly that we have clear shorter & longer-term path to monetization?
06.03.19 08:30:16<editable-dog>i feel its probably beneficial to the world, and i probably just cant stop working on it, unless for example it becomes irrelevanted by nars
06.03.19 08:31:10<editable-dog>so, i might as well have an idea of a business model, which would be making it into an android app focusing on providing an unified ui/virtual assistant on a phone
06.03.19 08:32:21<editable-dog>targeting phones also brings with it an obvious monetization venue, with the business model modelled after other open source with proprietary addons and proprietary distribution projects
06.03.19 08:33:26<editable-dog>but its definitely on the long term/just hopefully side
06.03.19 08:34:21<editable-dog>but short term the relevant work is also on the portfolio-building side
06.03.19 08:35:10<editable-dog>my idea is to finish the proof trace visualizer a bit, so it acts as a showcase for the whole reasoner work we've done so far and showcase for vue skills
06.03.19 08:35:27<editable-dog> / way to acquire vue skills
06.03.19 08:36:29<editable-dog>and when thats done, i will hopefully quickly finish the current iteration of the ldl, and be able to showcase that a well
06.03.19 08:37:11<editable-dog>which will actually make us look like doing something cool and advanced and really cutting edge
06.03.19 08:39:04<editable-dog>after that, we might decide that we want to make a new iteration with pmcfg, or i might actually start using the current system to build and organize my stuff
06.03.19 08:54:00<stoopkid> possibly, but this is something i would maybe come back to at some later point, same reasoning as i don't necessarily want to be stuck w/ major technical problems simultaneously as the problem of dealing with all the separate complexities of just trying to start a business, or ending up back in the same situation due to having put our eggs in some "cool and advanced feature" basket w/out having developed & refined our
                 <stoopkid> general business model & operations & methodologies
06.03.19 08:59:45<stoopkid> i feel like if we just focus on the business fundamentals first then we will come back to our projects with better methodology to apply to them
06.03.19 09:14:12<stoopkid> and with more financial breathing room, like you said you've got a years worth of savings, and i've got my parents helping me out w/ rent for school, but eventually that's gonna run out and then we would need to have some income stream.. so i feel like instead of trying to take this as an opportunity to work on our personal projects we should maybe take this as an opportunity to just work on getting as quickly as
                 <stoopkid> possible to actually running a business, and then next year or whenever our current income sources run out, we're already relatively secure in business and will have already laid a lot of the groundwork to actually either start to turn our personal projects into income generators or even just develop them as freeware due to having other income streams freeing us up from having to rely on  monetizing them
06.03.19 09:18:00<stoopkid> the way i figure, we're not gonna have a problem show-casing our cool & advanced stuff, the cool & advanced features aren't what cause us any difficulty, it's not what we have a lack of
06.03.19 09:20:44<stoopkid> we're not fluffies so it's not like we spend a year doing business & fluff & simple web design but just as vacuous self-promotion, we spend a year doing business & fluff & simple web design and then we actually have cool features we can start show-casing
06.03.19 09:26:12<stoopkid> i think "looking like we're doing something cool & advanced & really cutting edge" isn't really how i think of it
06.03.19 09:27:54<stoopkid> i think if i could pick one word i would want us to look like it would be "reliable"
06.03.19 09:31:04<stoopkid> i figure if our model is "reliability" we will eventually be able to work on all the cool & advanced features we would ever want to
06.03.19 09:40:55<stoopkid> so concretely on a technical level what that means to me is that we shouldn't focus on developing advanced features outside the context of already having developed the fully-featured system (or business model for developing those systems for clients) in which those advanced features would be hosted
06.03.19 09:43:17<stoopkid> so ex. our we gonna build our personal project as a web / mobile application? then we should already know how to develop a fully-featured web / mobile application & run a business model around a sw dev lifecycle for web / mobile apps
06.03.19 09:43:23<stoopkid> are* we
06.03.19 09:59:02<stoopkid> like, it would look better to be missing the advanced feature but have the solid fully-featured foundation that could support that advanced feature than to have the advanced feature but be missing that foundation
06.03.19 10:01:53<editable-dog>im not so convinced here, doing a personal project is how one acquires the skills to build proffesional projects
06.03.19 10:02:35<editable-dog>unles you get to play with the new technology on your current job
06.03.19 10:02:56<editable-dog>first build something for yourself, then for a friend, then for money
06.03.19 10:04:59<editable-dog>the mental framework im operating in now is getting oriented in freelancing sites, getting some experience there, trying to get some reputation there, and in parallel with it working up towards having a protfolio to show
06.03.19 10:05:58<editable-dog>we happen to have the reasoner and ldl at an almost presentable state, so im thinking it would be a waste not to finish it/polish it
06.03.19 10:06:43<editable-dog>now that i think of it, even my new_shit could be made into something presentable, maybe with megane's writing help
06.03.19 10:07:25<editable-dog>sooo...you probably want to sit down to create some business ideas/plans/idk, and im totally fine with that
06.03.19 10:08:33<editable-dog>its not like any of the things i think i should be doing now seem threatening to consume all my time
06.03.19 10:10:58<editable-dog>if you think we want to figure out if we can actually start appearing like/being a business that doesnt scrape for customers on upwork, but instead start a brand and figure out if we can offer some product (and maybe hire more people after that) thats fine, maybe we can come up with something
06.03.19 10:11:55<editable-dog>but otoh, i think we may as well find that we can compete on the freelancer sites, and form a few long-term relations with some actually well-paying clients
06.03.19 10:14:36<editable-dog>i guess i need to know if i can rely on you doing some gig together if i actually manage to get one, or you want to focus solely on some other path, but whichever way is fine with me
06.03.19 10:15:59<editable-dog>but i think continuing to map out this freelancer sites terrain is worthwhile
06.03.19 10:17:02<editable-dog>if you have some sort of product or similar idea in mind, i want to hear it
06.03.19 10:17:47<editable-dog>if you want to get down to building static websites, likewise, we'll do it together
06.03.19 10:18:35<editable-dog>i'll just need to have your abstract ideas translated into something concrete, as usual
06.03.19 10:18:49<editable-dog>before i can really get behind them
06.03.19 10:19:40<stoopkid> well yea ofc, if we have a gig then idk what other path i would be focused on that would imply not doing the gig
06.03.19 10:29:13<editable-dog>on these freelance sites you get both types of gigs, the ones where things at least seem to be specced out, and your task is to just code for somebody who is also a coder (like the one im spending some time on today), and the "i think i need a website or something" kind
06.03.19 10:29:20<editable-dog>not really, but almost
06.03.19 10:29:50<editable-dog>theres a ton of opportunities to practice analyzing clients business needs
06.03.19 10:38:22<editable-dog>so, what can we actually do, business-development-wise?
06.03.19 11:01:51<stoopkid> first thing i would think (other than just continuing to grab for w/e gigs we can get our hands on) is to actually start putting together a suite of specific solutions that we offer, but those should be like.. things that are fully ready to design/implement/deploy into a production environment w/ a fully modern UX, and with some kind of actual business plan formulated around providing that specific solution, like i
                 <stoopkid> would feel more comfortable aiming for "simple but complete" as opposed to "cool/advanced but partial" and then over-time expanding our range of fully-completable systems to eventually actually include our personal projects
06.03.19 11:04:15<stoopkid> so ex. simple static websites, not advanced but extremely completable and with the right kind of concerns for us to focus on in this initial phase
06.03.19 11:15:12*** Join: sirccloud (uid172590@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-cekphtxhgojjrolk, (unauthenticated): kook)
06.03.19 11:16:33<stoopkid> so it's basically two things going in parallel like you said, first just going out scraping up w/e jobs we can find, second is developing things on the business/branding/portfolio side but... i guess to me it's a bit more than developing a portfolio in the sense of it's also isolating specific services we can provide and then just refining them and expanding them
06.03.19 11:18:20<stoopkid> a bit more than developing a portfolio in the sense of "here's a listing of various jobs i've worked on"** it's also isolating... **
06.03.19 11:18:50<sirccloud> Yeah, makes sense
06.03.19 11:22:05<stoopkid> web is extremely versatile environment so it's not like we'd be shoe-horning ourselves into just doing that kind of work it's basically just starting off like "hey i'm here w/ a business, i have a simple but comprehensive business solution and can do other custom work" followed by "hey again, check out this cool new feature that's part of our suite of comprehensive business solutions", etc..
06.03.19 11:24:16<stoopkid> i mean we can get from there to e-commerce work, to mapping work, to online tutoring systems, to etc.. etc.. we're basically adjacent to every application
06.03.19 11:26:43<sirccloud> Like, long long time ago, i was fairly practiced in building desktop programs in VB and later Delphi. It never went beyond maybe one completed paid project and two stuck due to "customers" and abandoned, but looking back, it felt wholesome
06.03.19 11:27:35<sirccloud> Somebody needed something, i would analyze the situation, propose solution, and know how to implement it confidently
06.03.19 11:29:01<sirccloud> But what ive been doing last 15 years was taking a break from programming followed by jumping from thing to thing
06.03.19 11:29:20<sirccloud> And only gaining expertise in fringe/esoteric areas
06.03.19 11:29:50<sirccloud> Granted, all that seems to be going towards some eventual payoff
06.03.19 11:30:30<sirccloud> And i could do what i did back then with Qt
06.03.19 11:30:50<sirccloud> But the biggest demand is in web/mobile now
06.03.19 11:41:32<stoopkid> i'd be open to working with other systems besides web, i'd just have the same kind of approach (at least if it was something to start off the business with), come up with as close to a "hello world" service as we can, but make sure it's actually "a complete product/service" and expand from there, like we don't want to keep jumping from thing to thing w/o picking up comprehensive mainstream expertise, and we also can't
                 <stoopkid> afford to start off with any "heroic" projects as our first endeavors into a new ecosystem for us
06.03.19 11:51:14<stoopkid> like we need to be thinking small, but scalable and most importantly ready asap, and then we actually  have all the basic standard groundwork necessary to actually provide for the fully-featured scaffolding to actually carry the next-gen code we've been working on
06.03.19 11:53:48<stoopkid> like it's a pretty quick progression, in the grand scheme of things: you have some simple static sites, then some simple static sites with search bars, and then we're immediately adjacent to CNL work as a specific well-defined kind of service we can offer, and already have web framework stuff ready to bring that CNL into a production environment
06.03.19 12:17:07<stoopkid> so, even with jobs we get while we're just scraping and jumping around doing little patches here and there in other peoples' systems / code, this should be a particular service we offer
06.03.19 12:20:30<stoopkid> ex. we can isolate & classify standard sub-services of this (code/system patches vs. code/system take-overs vs. from-scratch dev/deployment outside of our standard service models) and refine them
06.03.19 12:33:57<stoopkid> i think we might want to avoid making any kind of service model around server-side work for a while and focus on maximizing what we can squeeze out of lightweight client-side applications
06.03.19 12:36:31<editable-dog>https://github.com/software-for-immortality/past_projects/blob/master/kbdbg2graphviz
06.03.19 12:45:59<sirccloud> 17:53:48 <stoopkid> like it's a pretty quick progression, in the grand scheme of things: you have some simple static sites, then some simple static sites with search bars, and then we're immediately adjacent to CNL work as a specific well-defined kind of service we can offer, and already have web framework stuff ready to bring that CNL into a production environment
06.03.19 12:46:32<sirccloud> Ok, i like that idea, obviously
06.03.19 12:48:49<sirccloud> So, what i wrote up above there, i dont consider this a "past project" to present on its own, more like a blog post kind of content
06.03.19 12:49:35<sirccloud> Its also for our own reference as well
06.03.19 12:56:55<stoopkid> so how long would you estimate it "should" take for us to pick some arbitrary stack at random out of the ones we've been looking at and test whether it can make a simple static site that we can actually consider a complete finished product?
06.03.19 12:57:16<stoopkid> i'm thinking this should be approximately a 1 day job
06.03.19 12:58:54<stoopkid> and then to actually implement another site in it should be (ideally substantially) less than a day (not including the time spent holding the client's hand through the process)
06.03.19 13:00:56<stoopkid> like assuming the chosen stack actually works we should be able to properly deploy one in a day
06.03.19 13:06:32<stoopkid> if it turns out it's not the right stack for us, oh well, it should only take another day to test the 2nd one
06.03.19 13:18:04<stoopkid> one thing that would probably speed up the process of trying out these different stacks is if we already had a clear picture of what we needed to be aiming for in terms of "design a custom but fully modern web site/app layout & stylings from scratch"
06.03.19 13:21:50<stoopkid> so that we'd basically have some baseline functionality to aim for
06.03.19 13:24:29<stoopkid> one thing we could do to try to give ourselves a baseline and start integrating megan into the process w/o needing her to get too involved right away is we could take some of the graphic design stuff she's already done and try to replicate some of it as web designs in w/e stack we're trying to tackle
06.03.19 13:29:29<stoopkid> maybe try to replicate it as exactly as possible even if we don't even necessarily want it as a web design, just so that we can be objective about quickly testing the front-end's capabilities for easily implementing an arbitrary graphic design, and not have to waste our time having to bring our own artistic input into the process until we actually need it ex. on the actual portfolio site
06.03.19 13:35:34<stoopkid> once we have some SSG stack where we actually have a complete development process for from-scratch design,implementation, deployment, & maintenance, that we're comfortable with, then we can use that to implement the first iteration of our site, and this SSG stack can be the first specific service we advertise on the site as well, so we'd already have: a site with good web design (fit for the ecosystem we're competing
                 <stoopkid> in), and some meaningful site content & a service to go on it
06.03.19 13:37:42<stoopkid> i figure if we actually sat down and really thought out how we want our site to look and what content we want on there, that should again be approximately a 1 day job
06.03.19 13:40:17<stoopkid> if on the first day where we learned the stack, we took meticulous documentation of the entire process and how it fit into a mock business model, then this documentation is already site-content to use on the 2nd day where we're designing our site
06.03.19 13:52:15<stoopkid> this documentation should also be able to start forming the basis of our actual business documentation, like we're gonna need to be able to provide professional-quality project documentation, financial documentation, actual cover letters, business plans, & standard 8" x 11" print media and etc..
06.03.19 14:05:26<stoopkid> we should also be working out any kinks in our collaborative dev process, including w/ megan, like be generally ready to go w/ what dev process we would follow doing the same job for a client so that we can avoid having to figure that out on the job
06.03.19 14:11:56<stoopkid> so i figure that's basically just 2-3 days (not necessarily consecutive) that would bootstrap us from here to a ready-to-go & implemented business model that we can just start expanding on
06.03.19 14:24:22<stoopkid> then i also don't think we need to think of it like we're just gonna do this for a little bit until we've "outgrown" this line of work or w/e, like even if we end up eventually incorporating CNL and other fancy features and start landing higher-valued jobs for fancier work it's not like we need to stop providing simple SSG as a legitimate part of the ecosystem of services we can provide, most importantly because even
                 <stoopkid> those bigger jobs might still use it for some smaller component
06.03.19 14:35:14<stoopkid> now, every one of the things we do on those 2-3 days can be expanded on, look at everything we did from a business perspective and see if we can do it more quickly, methodically & professionally, ex. what was the process for integration of unstructured site content, what documentation did we produce for this, can anything we did be isolated into a specific service that we can provide to complement the SSG service we
                 <stoopkid> already provide, etc..
06.03.19 14:35:45<stoopkid> like, if we need it, we can already be 100% positive that "they" need it
06.03.19 15:01:35<stoopkid> like on the getting up to speed day we need to be writing content, like professional writing content to be put on the site to describe what the service is and why we thought this stack makes for a good option, and when would it / wouldn't it make sense for a business to use
06.03.19 15:08:45<stoopkid> like maybe thinking of it less like "we're deploying this stack" and more like we're writing professional-quality documentation & analyses about deploying that stack and how it fits into a hypothetical business's operations (like ours for example)

06.03.19 16:33:30<editable-dog>well, all good ideas
06.03.19 16:33:56<editable-dog>i wouldnt really dare to guess an estimate, but im happy to go with yours
06.03.19 16:34:30<editable-dog>ill just add that if we're also trying to document the process in the process, its gonna take possibly substantially longer
06.03.19 16:34:48<editable-dog>like, five times more
06.03.19 16:35:37<editable-dog>buut...yeah, lets go with a mock site first, lets just use content from somewhere
06.03.19 16:41:47<editable-dog>the only thing with higher priority for me will be setting up a vulkan dev environment
06.03.19 16:42:23<editable-dog>so im prepared for one gig that i could land
06.03.19 16:43:14<editable-dog>i didnt win it originally but today the guy wrote me that the guy who won it isnt responding..
06.03.19 16:44:56<editable-dog>so, i guess we just copy somebody's site word for word, and never publish it
06.03.19 16:50:47<editable-dog>btw, an acquaintance of mine thinks i could have a part-time job where he works, he thinks they would be ok with two days a week
06.03.19 16:52:23<editable-dog>i remember that what was oficially 20 hours a week and in practice usually a bit more but sometimes also less, but also a lot of thinking about work outside of it, i remember that job kept me fairly exhausted
06.03.19 16:52:40<editable-dog>but still i am quite tempted to try this one
06.03.19 16:53:36<editable-dog>in the ideal case, it wont leave me exhausted, i will still have most of the week left, and it could stop my savings from thickening
06.03.19 16:55:05<editable-dog>+ experience and contacts in a field you would find interesting, they "optimize processess" in banks etc, whatever that means
06.03.19 17:03:57<editable-dog>haha well, im sure we could build something in a day, but lets consider this https://joes-gardening-services.business.site/#details
06.03.19 17:05:19<editable-dog>lets just steal the content and try to replicate it with gridless as fast as we can
06.03.19 17:20:30<editable-dog>sudo apt install whois
06.03.19 17:20:34<editable-dog>oops
06.03.19 17:20:53<editable-dog>anyway, i think we should try this one http://www.joesgardeningservice.com
06.03.19 17:21:41<editable-dog>our version will be naturally single-page, so navigation should be faster
06.03.19 17:21:55<editable-dog>and we can fix the background on the mobile version and maybe other things
06.03.19 17:22:26<editable-dog>in the end we can offer the new version to them
06.03.19 17:22:37<editable-dog>if we actaully couple it with a cms, that is
06.03.19 17:27:21<editable-dog>there is a chance that what we would offer them would also save the money on subscriptions to their current service
06.03.19 17:28:51<editable-dog>hehe
06.03.19 17:29:44<editable-dog>anyway, im sure that implementing/copying a design like that will take more than one day

07.03.19 11:20:22<stoopkid> not sure if you've told me about him before, what kind of work does he do?
07.03.19 11:35:19<sirccloud> Mostly sysadmin, networking, av
07.03.19 11:35:34<sirccloud> We did some sort of logging daemon once

07.03.19 11:49:07<sirccloud> Alllroght, i guess we need a new vps

08.03.19 01:58:21<stoopkid> yo
08.03.19 02:07:43<editable-dog>so i have a couple of thoughts from yesterday
08.03.19 02:09:35<editable-dog>gridsome is a framework for building websites
08.03.19 02:10:04<editable-dog>i guess it sums up to...we're gonna have a hard time competing against wordpress
08.03.19 02:10:27<editable-dog>wordpress gives users a cms
08.03.19 02:11:24<editable-dog>and the price of hosting it for each user is probably lowered by the number of users/clients
08.03.19 02:16:36<editable-dog>basically i set out to just copy the website, but then realized that if we should try to keep also the real business side in mind, then the task isnt to copy a website, but to find/set up a wordpress competitor
08.03.19 02:16:57<editable-dog>so..maybe there is something out there, so im gonna google that today
08.03.19 02:21:29<stoopkid> i mean.. there's people hiring for wordpress work so i don't really see wordpress as a competitor right now just another framework to potentially learn
08.03.19 02:22:54<stoopkid> https://www.freelancer.com/projects/php/Bid-for-Wordpress-Commerce-18896124/?w=f
08.03.19 02:27:41<stoopkid> and also i figured the idea w/ gridsome was that it was decoupled so you could have a vue front-end w/ arbitrary content through the graphql layer, so i.e. it would be gridsome + <some CMS(s) / ETL services>
08.03.19 02:29:47<editable-dog>yeas, it just brings the question what cms, where to host it, and where to host the resulting website
08.03.19 02:30:37<editable-dog>i just figured wordpress is something i want to stay away with, given all the horrorr security stories, that could only possibly come from horrorr php code inside
08.03.19 02:31:40<editable-dog>and given that its an estabilished industry already
08.03.19 02:32:20<editable-dog>but idk
08.03.19 02:36:13*** Join: sirccloud (uid172590@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-rhtzvnwrjhhnndku, (unauthenticated): kook)
08.03.19 02:38:14<stoopkid> well, benefit of static sites is it makes the "where to host the resulting website" question a lot easier; plus these are probably questions we should be answering anyway, as part of being a web dev service
08.03.19 02:39:15<stoopkid> in some cases it's actually the client's problem unless they're hiring us as long-term sysadmins, like where to host resulting website & what to do about its maintenance, although yea they do need a CMS
08.03.19 02:43:33<sirccloud> Well technically they woudlnt need a cms, they could edit stuff on theit pc
08.03.19 02:43:35<sirccloud> Their
08.03.19 02:44:21<stoopkid> well i guess i mean GUI content editor, running wherever
08.03.19 02:44:51<sirccloud> Yea me too i guess
08.03.19 02:47:59<stoopkid> https://forestry.io/
08.03.19 02:51:21<stoopkid> wrt hosting though we should probably at least have options ready for the client, so we should probably look at the standard ones ex. https://gridsome.org/docs/deploy-to-netlify
08.03.19 03:06:56<stoopkid> the ideal would really be something like a fully browser-side content editor that just connects to a publishing service via js
08.03.19 03:18:28<editable-dog>pretty much, and since all this code is already js, there might as well be the option to run the whole site-generation in the browser, and just pushing the result to an ftp
08.03.19 03:19:56<editable-dog>ok, ill check out the links later, gonna head off to my makeshift office now
08.03.19 03:20:22<editable-dog>i think after i finish exploring gridsome a bit, i might go back to pure vue, i got some videos stashed
08.03.19 03:20:39<editable-dog>and thats probably gonna lead me back to the proof trace visualizer
08.03.19 03:20:51<editable-dog>but it shouldnt be that long of a detour
08.03.19 03:21:32<editable-dog>but probably getting some actual practice with vue first is a good idea
08.03.19 03:25:17<editable-dog>you probably gonna go sleep now, right?
08.03.19 03:27:13<stoopkid> soon yea
08.03.19 03:27:51<stoopkid> maybe we should try a site replica in just vue rather than gridsome
08.03.19 03:29:07<editable-dog>yeah makes sense
08.03.19 03:29:18<editable-dog>or maybe we should really do the visualizer
08.03.19 03:29:34<editable-dog>im sure i can come up with plenty of data/content for it
08.03.19 03:36:36<stoopkid> hrm, i'd probably rather have a portfolio/site up + also some basic web layout for that visualization to fit into before we jump back into the visualizer, like i don't think difficulty setting up simple static sites implies we should jump into a more complex web layout task that relies on a reasoner
08.03.19 03:40:17<editable-dog>its not a more complex layout task, i got the basic thing set up with just one vue component
08.03.19 03:40:26<editable-dog>i was learning vue basics on it
08.03.19 03:40:59<editable-dog>so now i would continue with that
08.03.19 03:41:17<editable-dog>like, once you master components, you should get an idea of vuex and nuxt
08.03.19 03:41:46<editable-dog>but im probably gonna stick with just a couple more components
08.03.19 03:43:57<editable-dog>yeah the more i think about it the more i think this is the way to go
08.03.19 03:44:15<editable-dog>we can each do something else for a while
08.03.19 03:45:22<editable-dog>im positive that i wont have to waste too much time on the reasoner-specific logic part
08.03.19 03:48:32<editable-dog>and i guess im gonna take part in the site-building youre gonna be doign
08.03.19 03:50:08<editable-dog>im gonna give you a link to some vue videos that im probably gonna be re-watching too
08.03.19 03:55:25<stoopkid> hrm, if you really want to bring the reasoner into it at this point can we at least figure out how that's actually gonna fit into a specific business model? cause it's kind of advertising that we do reasoners which is maybe just half-correct in the same sense that "we do web dev" is currently only half-correct.. the difference being that the latter is a lot easier/faster to make actually correct
08.03.19 04:08:04<stoopkid> but, yea, in any case i could work on the general site layout / styling stuff and we could see how to integrate that w/ your visualizations in a clean way so then we could actually have it presented as a more-or-less complete web application on a more-or-less complete site
08.03.19 04:09:53<sirccloud> Well, doing practical reasoners aka business rule engines wouldnt entail all the formal correctness difficulties..but..
08.03.19 04:10:51<sirccloud> I dont have a business plan other than this being a part of our past projects/portfolio useful for getting gigs
08.03.19 04:12:07<sirccloud> Having something to show wrt doing sparql, linked data, business rule engines, maybe comp sci research because this thing really is cutting edge in terms of comp sci
08.03.19 04:13:23<sirccloud> And in general, if we end up applying for jobs again, its an answer to "what have you been doing in 2018?"
08.03.19 04:13:40<stoopkid> so can we come up with a specific "not jumping around" service (or set of services) to go along with this?
08.03.19 04:20:10<sirccloud> Not sure about not jumping around
08.03.19 04:22:59<sirccloud> In a awy, im already offering skills in a considerable number of areas just by myself
08.03.19 04:23:59<sirccloud> With you and pavel and taking on modern web dev, we're gonna have a long list of kinds of gigs we're open to
08.03.19 04:25:28<sirccloud> Talking about more own-business case though, this should tie into something linked data
08.03.19 04:26:37<sirccloud> Pavel is working in national technical library btw, and libraries are big on linked data
08.03.19 04:28:28<sirccloud> We can consider rdf as a cms format/source
08.03.19 04:30:25<sirccloud> Well, rdf should make *our* life easier, thats why we necame interested in it in the first place
08.03.19 04:32:08<sirccloud> Well, its definitely a good question that i'll keep pondering
08.03.19 04:34:43<stoopkid> i guess w/ the sem-web stuff we can fit at least that component into the web app dev/design model
08.03.19 04:37:47<stoopkid> w/ the reasoner aspect, i guess it's the question of.. how do we actually apply reasoners that fits into somebody's business model
08.03.19 04:41:30<sirccloud> I guess in a way, we're doing two or three things here. I feel confident with C-level hacking and maybe some other stuff, and im trying to build up a gig-landing portfolio. You have frontend skills but need to expand them to do gigs. The third thing is trying to develop a own-product set of skills/services
08.03.19 04:42:24<sirccloud> s/need/want
08.03.19 04:43:40<stoopkid> sounds about right
08.03.19 04:51:51<stoopkid> i've no idea how to showcase any of my agda work lol
08.03.19 05:29:55<sirccloud> I think we should
08.03.19 05:31:29<sirccloud> What do you consider teasonably finished, of your agda stuff?
08.03.19 05:34:38<sirccloud> Wrt doing 3 things at once, theres still the possibility that i can take a 2-days-per-week job
08.03.19 05:34:55<sirccloud> Maybe that'd make it easier to re-prioritize in some way
08.03.19 06:52:52<editable-dog>well, i guess the same goes for getting a reasonable amount of random freelance jobs
08.03.19 06:53:09<editable-dog>im in communication with two guys for c++ and c++/qt work

                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>if it is still relevant, i checked out your slides, I have worked a similar job before, so i should get up to speed with your current codebase reasonably quickly
                 <editable-dog>10:24 AM
                 <editable-dog>i see upwork has video call option, would you like to use it to give me an idea of the work required?

                 <editable-dog>how about this https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~017a24d0ca9f917098
                 <editable-dog>12:47 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>yes, that looks like an easy and well-specified job indeed. I would like to know if you have any preference with regards to this: We can make a "native" UI for the plugin, looking and acting as the rest of the application, OR the plugin can display a small window with the relay's control web page embedded (without a full web browser, no menus and tabs etc). This second way would be more future-proof, for example if you ever buy a bigger
                 <editable-dog>relay box, or want to control another web-controlled device. If you don't have a preference, i would suggest we try the webview method

                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
                 <editable-dog>hello Jindrich, option 1 is what i was thinking. but your option 2 is also interesting.
                 <editable-dog>1:03 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>option 2 is a bit experimental for me, but may also take me less time. I could try it first, and if there is a problem, i would do option 1 at no additional cost for you. At either case, i expect to have this done in at most 8 hours of work
                 <editable-dog>i assume you don't have a way to let me access your network, to test with an actual device?
                 <editable-dog>Anyway that is not a problem, the documentation for this relay seems very good
                 <editable-dog>PH
                 <editable-dog>1:05 PM
                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
08.03.19 07:33:32<editable-dog>yes - I can let you have access to the pc with device connected. - not a problem.
                 <editable-dog>1:05 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman

                 <editable-dog>when can you guys start ?
                 <editable-dog>1:06 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>right now
                 <editable-dog>PH
                 <editable-dog>1:08 PM
                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
                 <editable-dog>okay - my programmer for option 1 mentioned that this should work as a library compiled in msvc / QT ; with a ui plugin..
                 <editable-dog>1:09 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
08.03.19 07:33:33<editable-dog>ah, what is the reason this should be a separately-compiled plugin? To be honest i assumed we can make this a part of your application's source code
                 <editable-dog>PH
                 <editable-dog>1:10 PM
                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
                 <editable-dog>a class that can be instantiated and has all needed members to do specific tasks -
                 <editable-dog>we want to run this across several applications and just call it.
                 <editable-dog>1:11 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>ah, so you have several different Qt applications running on one control computer at the same time
                 <editable-dog>PH
                 <editable-dog>1:11 PM
                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
08.03.19 07:33:34<editable-dog>the app must be well designed as a re-usable classes where each relay can be reached from an instance of a vclass
                 <editable-dog>sometimes yes, but we have several different applications ; and we want to incorporate this device into them
                 <editable-dog>1:16 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>so you also plan to add maybe buttons to each individual app, where a button would directly control a particular relay?
                 <editable-dog>PH
                 <editable-dog>1:17 PM
                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
                 <editable-dog>correct. a small UI that we can drop in with 4 buttons.
                 <editable-dog>i think this should be 4-6 hours of work. i like that you are a 2 man team, so i want to start with this small task with you guys.
                 <editable-dog>1:21 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>Actually the other guy does not have Qt experience, only C++, but i hope to bring him up to speed
                 <editable-dog>PH
                 <editable-dog>1:21 PM
                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
                 <editable-dog>okay.. all of our work is in qt/msvc / vs studio ;
                 <editable-dog>your okay with option 1?
                 <editable-dog>i have to fly out to head home, but i will get you organized once i land.
                 <editable-dog>1:24 PM
08.03.19 07:33:35<editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>yes im ok with option one, i will have to learn a bit more of your intended organization of things with regards to this being a plugin, but we can work it out
                 <editable-dog>PH
                 <editable-dog>1:24 PM
                 <editable-dog>Pierre Huot
                 <editable-dog>okay..
                 <editable-dog>1:25 PM
                 <editable-dog>Jindrich Kolman
                 <editable-dog>ok, thanks, i'll be getting set up for development on windows (using mostly linux here) and wait for further messages

08.03.19 08:05:54*** Quit: sirccloud (uid172590@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-rhtzvnwrjhhnndku) left #atlas-project: Quit: Connection closed for inactivity
08.03.19 11:54:12<stoopkid> the web relay one looks nice; i can't access the other pages you linked
08.03.19 13:54:52<stoopkid> so.. considering what we discussed earlier i think it probably makes sense for us to split up the "develop own-product set of skills/services" work a bit w/ you working more on the back-end so you can continue focusing on our previous work & other work that you're more interested in and w/ me working more on front-end so that i can focus on basics & marketing & etc..
08.03.19 13:56:24<stoopkid> tho ofc whatever gigs come up we can tackle those together or divide it up on a per-job basis, this is just for  the parallel work of developing our branding & business model
08.03.19 14:00:43<editable-dog>yeah makes sense i guess
08.03.19 14:00:54<editable-dog>i see, his original posting was https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~015c60eca751dd3691
08.03.19 14:00:58<editable-dog>but..doesnt matter i guess
08.03.19 14:03:03<stoopkid> so, earlier we brought up the q of how to fit the reasoner stuff into a business model, another q we should probably think about is can we make the simple web stuff more interesting to you or maybe somehow position it closer to more interesting work for you?
08.03.19 14:06:55<stoopkid> maybe like, what kind of web apps currently exist that are like halfway between a simple site and the kind of application you would actually want to work on
08.03.19 14:10:17<editable-dog>well, i dont really feel like simple web stuff is not interesting for me
08.03.19 14:10:31<editable-dog>like, i do want to learn how to make a simple site with vue, for example
08.03.19 14:11:18<editable-dog>but in the long run, integration with some cnl ui like you brought up would be just perfect
08.03.19 14:15:58<stoopkid> so i guess search, accessibility & other things are immediately adjacent to that & within the standard web paradigm
08.03.19 14:17:50<stoopkid> i am thinking though that it maybe makes less sense to try to market ourselves as a web design service that can do other things & is expanding into other things, and more as general software devs that just have "web-enablement" as a standard part of our package
08.03.19 14:20:19<editable-dog>idk really, dont see a practical difference
08.03.19 14:20:49<editable-dog>seems just words one way or another
08.03.19 14:26:15<stoopkid> words matter, it's about how easily we can communicate to the client what work we can do, what work we want to do, and what quality of service they can expect, and it's also about a mental framework for the business
08.03.19 14:27:08<editable-dog>well, i can agree that we are rather expanding into web than from web
08.03.19 14:30:26<stoopkid> in this case the distinction is.. we might be general software devs, but only have dabbled in web, and only built snippets & components rather than fully-featured user-ready applications, so we're saying "web-enablement" is a standard part of the service, and from the other side of it, we might be simple static site designers but only have dabbled in general software dev, but here we're saying no we're general software
                 <stoopkid> developers (or business solutions designers in the case of less app-y and more business-y situations like a simple site) and can deploy those applications (or business solutions) to web
08.03.19 14:32:13<stoopkid> basically we want to tend towards having an increasingly refined & succinct description of what is the generalization encompassing the range of service we provide
08.03.19 14:32:55<stoopkid> increasingly accurate*, refined & succinct..
08.03.19 14:36:19<editable-dog>i feel we need to state our strong sides, and for me thats C and python
08.03.19 14:45:28<stoopkid> for me it would be math, pure & applied; comp sci & formal lang theory.. database/data-analysis/ETL stuff.. SQL mainly but i've dabbled enough in other things that i don't think the choice database would be the main source of difficulties for me on any job.. less experienced on any particular general purpose lang.. too much jumping around.. obv there's agda/Coq/etc.. but idk how to market that yet.. but also never
                 <stoopkid> encountered insurmountable difficulties working w/ various different general purposes langs ex. C/C++/python/perl/javascript/PHP/... so i feel like i really just need to pick one and solidify a basic skill-service like i'm doing on the web side.. probably something like C/C++/python/Qt..
08.03.19 14:48:17<stoopkid> i've worked w/ web-stacks & frameworks a lot tinkering w/ my/our own stuff so i'm relatively comfortable there minus what i've been discussing wrt that recently regarding stuff more on the graphic design / SEO / etc.. side and solidifying a basic (but complete) skill-service to start with
08.03.19 14:50:17<stoopkid> but i've only worked w/ it in that context & haven't kept good track of my work so very little to show at the moment for portfolio stuff and no paid work to show
08.03.19 14:52:35<stoopkid> i've got a publication in data analysis so that definitely makes that probably near the top for my strong sides from a portfolio pov
08.03.19 14:56:59<editable-dog>i think we'll be able to make the agda stuff presentable
08.03.19 14:58:39<editable-dog>and for a big part, if theres any reasonable way to get you involved, then you can just be there to make us work 2x faster by just staring at the code with me
08.03.19 14:59:02<editable-dog>like..this guy already basically said he gave us preference because he likes that we are a team
08.03.19 14:59:52<editable-dog>now he had a question on something windows networking specific, so i made a quick call to pavel and got back to him with a viable plan
08.03.19 15:02:15<editable-dog>but i can also already tell you that i dont want to be doing this kind of work for long
08.03.19 15:02:37<editable-dog>learning web dev would be much more exciting
08.03.19 15:04:48<stoopkid> what do you like about web dev / not like about the networking (other than windows)
08.03.19 15:06:42<editable-dog>networking would be next stage, now we are discussing the relay ui
08.03.19 15:07:03<editable-dog>in next stage he wants to monitor tcp traffic for when a device stops responding
08.03.19 15:07:57<editable-dog>idk, i suspect its probably just the learning part that makes the webdev stuff fun for now
08.03.19 15:08:28<editable-dog>but it also may be that webs have bigger audience than company-internal hw control programs
08.03.19 15:12:34<stoopkid> is the interactivity element a factor? like ex. would you rather be designing a game or UI than like an under-the-hood data processor or something?
08.03.19 15:14:46<editable-dog>yep
08.03.19 15:16:22<editable-dog>i enjoy interactive applications, but you know i also enjoy doing some down-to-metal stuff
08.03.19 15:17:32<editable-dog>but interactivity isnt enough for me, because right now the job is building just an ui for something and im not excited
08.03.19 15:21:35<editable-dog>well, in general i like thinking about people, not systems
08.03.19 15:21:45<editable-dog>when youre building/designing a website, its in your hands
08.03.19 15:22:04<editable-dog>how people will interact, how you'll influence then, how clearly you communicate, what you achieve with it
08.03.19 15:22:35<editable-dog>buttons for relay control in a wielding monitor application just dont have that
08.03.19 15:23:25<editable-dog>so, i like to deal with the psychological and physiological side
08.03.19 15:32:17<stoopkid> hrm, so would you say you're more interested in applications that connect people (ideally a wide audience) with complex data & user experiences than in, say, an industrial automation application?
08.03.19 15:39:39<stoopkid> for example, a cutting-edge personal assistant app, a cutting-edge semantic-web query engine, etc..
08.03.19 16:02:12<editable-dog>definitely
09.03.19 01:59:43<editable-dog>yo

09.03.19 02:06:59<editable-dog>￼
                 <editable-dog>Hi, your bid on my job seems quite convincing about related experience. But your price is too high for your reputation. I'm having this man here doing the job, but in case he didn't finish, I may need you. The guy only charge me $150. https://www.freelancer.com/u/donghyukchung
                 <editable-dog>Anyways could you show me some OpenGL and GUI projects that you've done before?
                 <editable-dog>06 MAR 2019 · 11:36 AM
                 <editable-dog>Fair fair. Let's stay in touch, i can take time to study the CEGUI code and maybe re-evaluate the estimate. For OpenGL, i for example ported the nerverot screensaver to it: https://github.com/koo5/lemon-3/blob/master/demos/nerverot/nerverot.c . I have never done serious conventional GUI work with OpenGL, at most like this: https://github.com/koo5/lemon-3/blob/master/src/buttons.cpp , or with pyglet here
                 <editable-dog>https://github.com/koo5/new_shit/tree/dbd49b5eb01d613c0dd3857ec06df704f0e9b384 . I have built a serious QT desktop app and worked on another in my last job.
                 <editable-dog>￼
                 <editable-dog>Your code seems good. You can take a look at current CEGUI's renderer modules to understand a little about what I'm trying to achieve. All GUI geometries and other resources are generated by CEGUI itself so I need to render those using my graphics library. My guy is not so responsive, 2 days has passed and I asked multiple times about progress but he only reads and doesn't reply. Maybe he's busy on another job or something. I will
                 <editable-dog>update frequently for you since I would cancel that guy and I really need to finish my project.
                 <editable-dog>ok, i get the general idea, i will dig into it a bit
                 <editable-dog>08 MAR 2019 · 4:43 PM
                 <editable-dog>￼
09.03.19 02:07:00<editable-dog>How is it going? Seems like my guy is unable to show a progress so end of Saturday is my deadline for him. I got another bid from an OpenGL guy too, it's 200. So here is my offer to you: if in 2 days (start after Sunday because I'll inform you status of the Chinese guy first) you demonstrated a good progress on this project, for example your analysis on the problem and some possible solutions, I can pay you 200 for the completion. If
                 <editable-dog>after 2 days without significant progress but you're still confident to complete it in a week I can pay you 150.
                 <editable-dog>08 MAR 2019 · 10:49 PM
                 <editable-dog>hi there. I browsed around in the CEGUI code and docs for second time now, i have to honestly tell you that i dont feel comfortable with this project, because i dont have prior experience with either CEGUI or your backend, and spending significant time to get to know them on my own is currently not in line with my other priorities. I feel i would need significant handholding to even figure out what exactly needs to get done.
                 <editable-dog>09 MAR 2019 · 5:43 AM
                 <editable-dog>￼
09.03.19 02:07:03<editable-dog>Sure I will instruct you to use my lib as long as you find you can find out problems with my guidance. First you will port the geometry buffer to Saga3D's mesh buffer, render it, see how it goes, compare with other renderers (OpenGL, D3D) to see if there are glitches. The price will still be 150. I believe that this is your first project on freelancer.com so you'll have more motivation. Do you use Linux or Windows?

09.03.19 02:27:06<editable-dog>sorry, i can't guess the scope of this work, so i'd only do it on a per-hour basis. Otherwise it is too much risk for me. I am not that desperate for freelancer stars￼
09.03.19 02:59:05<editable-dog>I think you're afraid of it. The scope is already described. Vertex buffer, texture, render target. All GUI examples have been done, resources are provided. If one example works, everything works.
                 <editable-dog>You'll be making the glue code between 2 libraries.
                 <editable-dog>￼
                 <editable-dog>If you don't need this chance, then fine I'll spend more for real OpenGL expert.
                 <editable-dog>you are right, i am afraid. If my curiosity gets the better of me and i spend a half of today exploring the code, then i might write you again. Otherwise i wish you good luck with cool project
                 <editable-dog>￼
                 <editable-dog>OK, we're gonna check back on Sunday morning alright? If you could, let's read the description again and see other renderer modules of CEGUI. I know how to do this job but the fact is I don't have time. So believe me that I can help you through it. 1 week is fine for me.
                 <editable-dog>￼
09.03.19 02:59:07<editable-dog>I did both. Yes, lets check back.
09.03.19 03:02:23<editable-dog>forestry and netlify look good. Though im still not sure how we'd adapt them or offer service with them. I worry these kind of services are just a bubble-funded startups and are prone to go out in a few years

10.03.19 14:07:47<editable-dog>yo
10.03.19 14:08:13<stoopkid> hey
10.03.19 15:14:41<editable-dog>if you ever get bored with whatever you're doing, i totally suck at jsonld framing
10.03.19 15:15:09<editable-dog>and its one of things that i'd like to feel competent with in the long run
10.03.19 15:15:38<editable-dog>although i also could go dig into the code, it is fairly readable
10.03.19 15:15:47<editable-dog>but its just not high priority
10.03.19 15:31:22<editable-dog>how's frontend design going?
10.03.19 15:34:13<stoopkid> getting closer; haven't made much more progress since yesterday tho cause i had to spend some time on my classwork
10.03.19 17:09:11<editable-dog>i could say i was 2 thirds done with the tracing, if i didnt just run into an issue i didnt realize earlier
10.03.19 21:31:53<stoopkid> we could say we're 2 thirds done w/ tau if not for that heh
10.03.19 21:33:52<stoopkid> making a bit of progress w/ the web stuff
10.03.19 21:34:56<stoopkid> even this simple thing seems to spiral into infinite complexity but i feel like i'm at least managing to wrap my mind around the problem-space enough that i won't often be totally blind-sided by a problem
10.03.19 21:38:17<stoopkid> took a look at json-ld framing.. i get the basic idea but i'll need to study it some more as well
10.03.19 21:40:29<stoopkid> after i get a bit more settled in w/ the basic web-dev stuff i'll be happy to start looking into that in more detail
10.03.19 21:43:27<stoopkid> i thought a bit more about our discussions earlier it seems like in some ways we're on different ends of some spectrums regarding what it is we want to do / why we want to do it
10.03.19 22:17:32<stoopkid> got pulled away; i feel like that could work to our advantage though, i might've answered oppositely to each of those q's i asked you, among other things we've discussed
10.03.19 22:21:49<stoopkid> ex. for me interactivity is not really any kind of factor; i mean it's interesting, in the same way that something non-interactive is still interesting, i guess in the same way that doing math w/ pen & paper is still interesting to me.. audience is definitely a factor, which goes hand-in-hand w/ interactivity but i guess that's only really a factor to me from a business PoV, or maybe a political PoV (which i'm
                 <stoopkid> off-and-on about whether or not i even believe in it)
10.03.19 22:23:40<stoopkid> and wrt UX vs. industrial automation again i'd probably be the opposite
10.03.19 22:24:46<stoopkid> i guess i'm the opposite maybe specifically in terms of preferring systems over people, as horrible as that sounds lol
10.03.19 22:28:46<stoopkid> like i like people, but probably the more that people can be taken out of the equation of the problem i'm working on, the better i'll be w/ that problem
10.03.19 22:34:02<stoopkid> i think it's kind of a habit from math/science academia... human mind has tended to be the limiting factor so there's sort of a devaluation of the human intellect itself relative to the achievements that intellect has brought about
10.03.19 22:36:42<stoopkid> so ex. in industrial automation i'd just be dealing w/ nature & logic not peoples' subjective opinions about these things
10.03.19 22:46:02<stoopkid> idk, maybe it's not so horrible, and maybe it's not opposite.. i could potentially phrase that rather as i prefer working "on" systems, and working "with" people rather than "on" people, but i just have anxiety about trying to get it to be the former rather than the latter in a business scenario that i may potentially be depending on?
10.03.19 22:48:13<stoopkid> idk
10.03.19 22:51:19<stoopkid> but in more concrete terms, i get the general sense that you, understandably, don't want to & don't need to be (w/ your portfolio & level of comfortability) sacrificing doing more cool/advanced/interesting work specifically tailored to your interests in order to be getting work whereas for me the only standards really are ethical heh
10.03.19 22:52:12<stoopkid> i guess maybe every aspect of this is so much further outside of my comfort zone than i had originally anticipated it would be that i'm still trying to wrap my mind around it
10.03.19 22:55:06<stoopkid> but don't worry i'm not gonna quit over that or anything just trying to acknowledge it so i can fit it into a strategy for managing it
10.03.19 23:00:20<stoopkid> so i guess for me, in more concrete terms, i'm totally cool w/ spending more time on the more mundane elements of all of this, like rather than a strategy of splitting up work between back-end / front-end, have a general strategy of splitting up work between cool vs. mundane
10.03.19 23:02:53<stoopkid> i have too many mundane concerns to work on anything "cool" (at the moment), it's just a fact, they'll want CNL, i'll be focused on character encodings; they'll want a reasoner i'll be focused on philosophy etc...
10.03.19 23:04:45<stoopkid> i can break through my analysis paralysis, but only on problems of extremely limited scope or extreme flexibility in acceptable results
10.03.19 23:10:40<stoopkid> hence why i'd tried to narrow down our business model to such extreme minimalism & fluffy simplicity
10.03.19 23:19:51<stoopkid> idk i'm really mathematician first, scientist 2nd, engineer 3rd, businessman 4th, and for business i need to be the exact opposite of that
11.03.19 00:22:18<editable-dog>idk, one thing i'm sure of is that while being it at together is good, actually working together is even much better
11.03.19 00:23:43<editable-dog>so i feel that at some point, we should take a pause to evaluate which one of our sub-directions has the best chance to succeed
11.03.19 00:26:38<editable-dog>i think your focus probably makes more sense, deciding on a product/service we eventually want to get rich off, and only taking random freelance jobs as a way to get there
11.03.19 00:33:26<stoopkid> well as far as maximizing chance of financial success i would still think that would be taking some broad interpretation of "business infrastructure" to maximize audience of the brand & focus on the right things to actually be as generalized as possible across essentially arbitrary businesses, and then refine that into what exactly we actually want that to mean
11.03.19 00:41:38<stoopkid> i figure no matter who we're working for, everything about the project is ultimately subsidiary to theirs or their organizations' financial/business interests, and a significant portion of available work will be devoted solely to that, and that this isn't gonna change in the foreseeable future
11.03.19 00:45:42<stoopkid> so i guess iow i don't feel we need to take any sub-direction in particular we need to rather focus on how the gestalt of our various subdirections provides some kind of fundamental *business* service, as opposed "programming service"
11.03.19 00:51:35<stoopkid> we certainly wouldn't want to orient ourselves around, for example, some specific programming language
11.03.19 00:51:59<stoopkid> say.. python or C++ or even the web-stack
11.03.19 00:52:45<stoopkid> computer languages are just a symptom/side-effect of our work, no particular computer language is the fundamental aspect of it, we do human-level work
11.03.19 01:03:22<stoopkid> and i figure we're not really in the product industry we're only really in the service industry.. we've floated the idea a bit but do you really want to sell a proprietary software product, even just as a premium features kind of thing? idk still something to think about but i figure that's a generally riskier model to focus on especially if we don't already have the product, and even after we have the product it can
                 <stoopkid> be obsoleted
11.03.19 01:08:34<stoopkid> to me the model is basically like, we're in business, we have all kinds of things we need to do wrt starting a business, every single one of them is related to tech, so we actually can just bootstrap a business w/ longevity out of just mastering what it takes for us to start our own business in the first place & then breaking that down into its more basic components so that we can be as strategic in our application of
                 <stoopkid> it as possible
11.03.19 01:10:38<stoopkid> ex. we need a website, there's a whole web-tech stack related to this, we can learn that stack, we can build a website & sell websites
11.03.19 01:11:44<stoopkid> like we don't need to guess too much at the market cause we already know (or can pretty easily find out) more or less what literally every business is gonna need in order to even be a business in the first place
11.03.19 01:17:17<stoopkid> but ultimately i would say this doesn't really need to have too much implications wrt what work we actually do? like this is all pretty open-ended it's basically just a matter of how we market ourselves and coherently develop a brand
11.03.19 01:27:40<stoopkid> and we can just attach concrete things to that to make us relevant to w/e the actual current programming market is
11.03.19 01:30:24<stoopkid> like a programming language isn't what's gonna be our downfall in any sw dev scenario
11.03.19 01:30:35<stoopkid> it's gonna be domain-specific logic
11.03.19 01:32:43<stoopkid> it's gonna be coming back to the same client 10 times to fix his app cause we made some obvious beginner mistakes in CRM design or graphic design or SEO or w/e..
11.03.19 01:34:15<stoopkid> or just having to spend too long w/ clients in general due to inability to just pull up some basic boilerplate shit to set their expectations & help them properly refine their demands
11.03.19 01:37:03<stoopkid> not knowing what to even build in the first place in some cases, ex. an AI crypto-trading app
11.03.19 06:46:25<editable-dog>yea this diversity is definitely to our advantage
11.03.19 07:08:27<editable-dog>>sell a proprietary software product, even just as a premium features kind of thing?
11.03.19 07:11:19<editable-dog>yea i definitely eventually do, but we obviously cant put all eggs in that basket
11.03.19 07:11:32<editable-dog>while money's running out
11.03.19 07:19:32<editable-dog>but like i said before, theres still the option that i'll get a two-days-a-week job that will stop my money from running out, and then maybe i could dream bigger, but that wouldnt probably change your situation, so idk
11.03.19 07:20:50<editable-dog>also, i like this idea of building/writing down a portfolio/services we offer etc, thinking about it and kind of making it a real thing
11.03.19 07:21:07<editable-dog>on a real own-made website, definitely
11.03.19 07:21:49<editable-dog>i feel its something that will definitely be to our advantage in future
11.03.19 07:22:20<editable-dog>same for getting our feet wet in freelancing over upwork etc
11.03.19 07:22:42<editable-dog>if only to know if we can make money that way
11.03.19 07:26:30<editable-dog>well at any case we should probably stick more to the original idea of working together, so let me know when you're working on whatever, and ill try to jump in
11.03.19 08:27:31<editable-dog>emacsclient is nice
11.03.19 08:27:58<editable-dog>you M-x emacs-server, then run emacsclient -c in another terminal
11.03.19 08:28:06<editable-dog>it works as expected
11.03.19 08:28:54<editable-dog>err M-x start-server
11.03.19 09:22:44<stoopkid> yea worst comes to worst i'd just get a 20-hr/week or less job to supplement whatever we're making from this so i'm not too worried i really don't need a huge amount of $; wrt proprietary sw product model i'm not necessarily opposed to it but also not really generally motivated towards it; i'd probably try to pursue a donation-based/crowd-funding model before resorting to proprietary.. something i was already thinking
                 <stoopkid> about looking into again soon
11.03.19 09:25:28<stoopkid> longer-longer-term i'm even less worried cause it looks like US might very well be headed in the direction of universal basic income
11.03.19 09:32:29<stoopkid> right now i'm just working through some real basic web concepts & bouncing around quite a bit just sort of getting oriented and coming up with a general outline of how to get from scratch to a professional-quality website
11.03.19 09:36:07<stoopkid> right now it's mainly just down to the process of coming up w/ graphical layouts & knowing generally what to expect when trying to translate those layouts into HTML/CSS
11.03.19 09:44:11<stoopkid> i figure in general if we're gonna be UI/UX designers there won't be any substitute for being graphic designers on at least some basic level
11.03.19 09:48:28<editable-dog>well afaik donation-based doesnt work, but crowdfunding would definitely be worth a try. At any case, the system i envision will not work unless it will essentially be free, and also will not fullfil its purpose if there will be a possibility to build a traditional paid-support business around it. .. so.. im only thinking paid mobile app in the store, with proprietary mobile os integrations, maybe proprietary addons.. and a fully free
                 <editable-dog>desktop version
11.03.19 09:49:09<editable-dog>or an ad-supported mobile version?
11.03.19 09:49:32<editable-dog>at any case the money has to come from somewhere
11.03.19 09:51:13<editable-dog>well im not scared of graphic design...and i know my gimp well...but im not sure if im much of an artist
11.03.19 09:51:26<editable-dog>more like an usability freak
11.03.19 09:52:02<editable-dog>but graphic work is something i might take on
11.03.19 09:52:26<editable-dog>another area that i'll have some inclination to that might sound unexpected is SEO
11.03.19 09:53:55<editable-dog>back when i did a website or two, it came down to just following a set of common sense rules
11.03.19 09:54:32<stoopkid> that is somewhat unexpected but i'm also interested in that.. mainly just from a web-business necessity PoV though; is there anything about SEO in particular that makes you inclined to it?
11.03.19 09:55:21<editable-dog>probably that it largely just means not doing anything stupid on your website
11.03.19 09:55:46<editable-dog>im not inclined to the shady practices like paid backlinks etc, obviously
11.03.19 09:57:55<stoopkid> yea i figure generically it just means knowing what web-crawlers are out there and how to make your site readable to the ones you care about
11.03.19 09:58:35<editable-dog>yea
11.03.19 09:59:11<editable-dog>and spicing your pages with some keywords, if that's still the practice
11.03.19 09:59:35<editable-dog>google might have started frowning upon that since
11.03.19 10:00:05<stoopkid> i figure that can transition relatively easily into web-crawling/scraping stuff too, so, i think it fits pretty well
11.03.19 10:00:55<editable-dog>maybe
11.03.19 11:17:11<editable-dog>i turned down the CEGUI guy, he wouldn't budge with the pricing or terms
11.03.19 11:17:56<editable-dog>now waiting for the QT guy to write, if he doesnt, we're back to square one in this

11.03.19 20:14:03<editable-dog>did you say you had flight license, or was it somebody else?

11.03.19 20:14:59<stoopkid> i used to fly but never ended up getting my license
11.03.19 20:16:12<editable-dog>ok, got it almost right
11.03.19 20:18:34<stoopkid> would be an interesting gig
11.03.19 20:19:08<stoopkid> also, as far as AI problems go, this one is maybe on the easier side: https://www.freelancer.com/projects/project-18925415/?w=f
11.03.19 20:26:30<editable-dog>job not found
11.03.19 20:27:00<stoopkid> aaand disappeared when i refreshed.. ok nvm heh
11.03.19 20:27:29<stoopkid> in any case it was for reading pictures of license plates
11.03.19 20:30:04<editable-dog>sounds like an opencv job
11.03.19 20:36:30<stoopkid> i haven't checked that out yet but looks cool, i'd be open to trying that out once i get back more to the hacking/engineering rather than design stuff
11.03.19 20:46:49<editable-dog>i think i have enough freelancer for a couple of days again

12.03.19 09:56:47<editable-dog>morning
12.03.19 10:13:37<stoopkid> yo
12.03.19 10:34:42<editable-dog>how did test go
12.03.19 10:35:40<editable-dog>if you want to jump in to some beginner vue work, i think i need a computed property set up
12.03.19 10:36:20<editable-dog>not sure exactly how they're done
12.03.19 10:39:05<stoopkid> test was fine, and sure
12.03.19 10:39:43<editable-dog>i dont by any means mean this is another mundane job that you should do, just that you might as well learn this bit of vue before me
12.03.19 10:41:12<editable-dog>https://github.com/koo5/univar/blob/master/pyco_visualization/html/index.html
12.03.19 10:41:32<editable-dog>should we skype?
12.03.19 10:43:57<stoopkid> in a bit sure, making breakfast at the moment
12.03.19 10:44:05<editable-dog>sure
12.03.19 10:58:58<editable-dog>nvm, it doesnt make sense for you to jump in in the middle of all this domain-specific complexity i think
12.03.19 11:30:36<stoopkid> alright well i guess i'll keep working on expanding the web layouts stuff in the meantime then but if you have something that you think makes sense for me to jump into i'll be happy to check it out, and in a couple days or so i might be more ready to start jumping back into the proof trace stuff in general
12.03.19 11:33:06<editable-dog>well if you do feel like jumping a bit into the deep end, ...
12.03.19 11:44:22<stoopkid> maybe instead of jumping directly into the deep end we might see if we can start w/ placing the visualization interface into some more complete web layout?
12.03.19 11:51:45<stoopkid> alternatively i could just start w/ that while you continue working on your current tasks w/ it and then we could meet somewhere in the middle to combine the work, and then i could adjust the layout from there based on your input
12.03.19 11:58:24<editable-dog>more complete in what way?
12.03.19 12:05:49<editable-dog>http://loworbit.now.im/univar/runs/tests_clean_existentials_addition2_0/html/
12.03.19 12:07:46<stoopkid> mainly graphically, though ofc there's usability stuff that could potentially go along w/ that like a menu/commands bar for controlling the widget
12.03.19 12:10:41<editable-dog>yeah theres a shitton of stuff that could be done, so, if you play with a it a bit that would be great
12.03.19 12:12:00<editable-dog>theres one outstanding but, and that is that some locals arent updated in the view when you're stepping forward
12.03.19 12:12:20<editable-dog>if you go to step 8 and then back to 7, one binding will suddenly appear
12.03.19 12:12:47<editable-dog>i have to figure out how to tell vue to watch these nested objects
12.03.19 12:13:01<editable-dog>and variable names are missing hehe
12.03.19 12:14:13<editable-dog>and i still have to make the reasoner emit locals for builtins, currently when a builtin has locals, the chain of variables in the visualization break
12.03.19 12:14:15<editable-dog>s
12.03.19 12:14:59<editable-dog>"navigation status" doesnt update, due to how vue works
12.03.19 12:15:47<editable-dog>those should be all the outright gotchas
12.03.19 12:16:04<editable-dog>im quite proud of it hehe
12.03.19 12:18:11<stoopkid> so.. first thing would be, what is our goal for this interface? i'm assuming it would be a widget that can be plugged into any site that's hooked up to the inferencer on the back-end, and that debugging a proof-trace is actually gonna be very specialized task that few people are gonna be doing (instead they'll be doing things like running queries, filtering outputs, managing the kb, etc.. for the most part) ?
12.03.19 12:20:13<editable-dog>even people running queries on websites is kinda further than i thought of it, i only intended this as a debugger for the reasoner/queries
12.03.19 12:26:03<stoopkid> i figure if we're going this far wrt building a web-enabled graphical debugger we might want to think about expanding that out into a full browser dashboard analogous to the kind of things available for managing other databases
12.03.19 12:27:27<editable-dog>well, we definitely could
12.03.19 12:28:19<editable-dog>at the very least, we could start with the basic usability improvements
12.03.19 12:28:35<editable-dog>like, putting the rule list onto its own page/tab
12.03.19 12:28:53<editable-dog>navigation from coro_state to its rule
12.03.19 12:29:06<editable-dog>actually rendering the rules in a reasonable way
12.03.19 12:29:22<editable-dog>navigation across var bindings
12.03.19 12:29:46<editable-dog>option to hide uninteresting rules
12.03.19 12:30:06<editable-dog>adding a tab with literal reasoner output
12.03.19 12:34:58<editable-dog>but..ill probably just need to finish the variables and builtins stuff to actually be able to debug something with it
12.03.19 12:35:50<editable-dog>but..if you want to start with one layout/design thing, then putting the rule listing into its own tab would be seriously helpful
12.03.19 12:36:37<editable-dog>and..whatever you think would make things more presentable
12.03.19 12:48:24<stoopkid> i seem to be having some issues running the visualizations can you check whether the readme is up-to-date w/ your current process?
12.03.19 12:49:26<editable-dog>hehe doubtful
12.03.19 12:49:34<editable-dog>go into kbdbg2graphviz2
12.03.19 12:49:40<editable-dog>run npm i
12.03.19 12:51:16<stoopkid> go into kbdbg2graphviz2 as in "run pyin/kbdbg2graphviz2.py" ?
12.03.19 12:51:35<editable-dog>cd
12.03.19 12:51:56<editable-dog>its a directory in root
12.03.19 12:52:09<editable-dog>wait
12.03.19 12:52:12<stoopkid> i don't seem to have that; you mean kbdbg2jsonld2 ?
12.03.19 12:52:26<editable-dog>right
12.03.19 12:52:27<editable-dog>sorry
12.03.19 12:57:20<stoopkid> alright and then it's just this command: ./pyin/tau2.py ./pyco_runner.sh examples/socrates  2>&1 | tee  `date "+%F-%H-%M-%S"` | grep ":test:" ?
12.03.19 12:57:41<editable-dog>that should work
12.03.19 12:57:52<editable-dog>my full command line these days is
12.03.19 12:58:13<editable-dog>reset; env PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 ./pyin/tau2.py --only-id 0   "./pyco_runner.sh --nolog 0 --novalgrind 1 --nodebug 0  --notrace false --trace_proof 1 --oneword false  --trace_unification 1  " tests/clean/existentials/addition2
12.03.19 13:01:33<stoopkid> hm, still seems to be some issues; the result of this should be that it dumps the pyco stuff and visualization into a directory under runs/ ?
12.03.19 13:03:23<editable-dog>yes
12.03.19 13:10:13<editable-dog>whats the output?
12.03.19 13:10:31<editable-dog>maybe i should make a docker image
12.03.19 13:13:44<stoopkid> https://pastebin.com/ZBvMjeZa
12.03.19 13:14:00<stoopkid> looks like the issue is maybe that it's just not loading the trace file, not sure why though
12.03.19 13:14:18<editable-dog>i mean whats the output of the command line
12.03.19 13:14:31<editable-dog>ah
12.03.19 13:14:46<editable-dog>go into runs/.../
12.03.19 13:15:22<editable-dog>python3 -m http.server
12.03.19 13:17:02<stoopkid> same output at localhost:8000 now
12.03.19 13:19:35<editable-dog>like...
12.03.19 13:19:37<editable-dog>cd runs/tests_n3_dev_testcases_tests_simple_socrates_tau_0/
                 <editable-dog>koom@koom-KVM ~/u/r/tests_n3_dev_testcases_tests_simple_socrates_tau_0> 
12.03.19 13:19:38<editable-dog>python3 -m http.server
12.03.19 13:24:47<stoopkid> yea it shows a directory listing and when i navigate to the html directory it shows the same output
12.03.19 13:25:23<editable-dog>ls runs/tests_n3_dev_testcases_tests_simple_socrates_tau_0/

12.03.19 13:25:50<editable-dog>trace0.js
12.03.19 13:26:13<stoopkid> ok i seem to be missing rules.jsonld
12.03.19 13:27:52<editable-dog>then the node stuff didnt work right
12.03.19 13:28:23<editable-dog>you should be able to go to kbdbg2jsonld2 and ...
12.03.19 13:28:41<stoopkid> looking back over the inferencer output looks like it had a couple errors: https://pastebin.com/yGqcAHxm
12.03.19 13:30:39<editable-dog>n3 missing again, thats weird
12.03.19 13:31:10<editable-dog>cat package-lock.json | grep n3
12.03.19 13:31:51<editable-dog>ah youre probably gonna have to pull once more
12.03.19 13:33:15<stoopkid> alright pulled and now that grep shows ""n3": {
                 <stoopkid>       "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/n3/-/n3-1.0.4.tgz", ..."
12.03.19 13:33:31<editable-dog>ok maybe it will work now
12.03.19 13:46:28<stoopkid> well it's not having the missing n3 error anymore but still not generating rules.jsonld
12.03.19 13:47:22<editable-dog>can you paste the command line and output again?
12.03.19 13:50:44<stoopkid> https://pastebin.com/KV8JcbTF
12.03.19 13:51:26<editable-dog>i guess npm i requests
12.03.19 13:51:41<editable-dog>ideally in the kbdbg2jsonld2 dir
12.03.19 13:55:26<stoopkid> looks like `requests` is a python module
12.03.19 13:55:39<editable-dog>ohh
12.03.19 13:59:35<editable-dog>something like pip -r requirements.txt should fix that
12.03.19 14:02:12<editable-dog>pip install -r requirements.txt
12.03.19 14:19:20<stoopkid> well, it finds the requests module now but still seems to be getting some kind "Connection refused" errors: https://pastebin.com/48RfcZVa
12.03.19 14:22:51<editable-dog>can you try tweaking pyin/pyco.py line 998?
12.03.19 14:23:13<editable-dog>maybe we're not giving the node server  enough time to start
12.03.19 14:29:46<stoopkid> yep that's what it was, changing from 2 to 10 fixed it
12.03.19 14:32:21<stoopkid> later we can probably change that to have it keep trying to query the node server every second or so until it comes up and then every 10-30 seconds or so query the user to see if they want to keep waiting
12.03.19 14:33:15<editable-dog>thats a good idea, i wanted to wait on some sort of confirmation output from the server, but just retrying is better idea
12.03.19 14:33:39<editable-dog>screw users tho, we can always just ctrl-c
12.03.19 14:33:50<stoopkid> lol
12.03.19 14:33:52<stoopkid> or that
12.03.19 14:36:44<stoopkid> alright i'm gonna take a break from this for a bit and mull over some ideas while i work on some web layouts stuff; and later before i really dive in i'm gonna try to see if i run into any issues building from scratch on a fresh environment
12.03.19 14:39:54<editable-dog>would be nice but maybe if you can just commit all the changes / update the README, and i could try building on a fresh machine sometime
12.03.19 14:39:59<editable-dog>either the new vps, or docker
12.03.19 15:14:32<stoopkid> ok i sent a pull request
12.03.19 15:16:34<editable-dog>nice, we have a pull request!
12.03.19 16:33:47<editable-dog>variable names are in place
12.03.19 17:41:48<editable-dog>im getting bored of it
12.03.19 17:41:54<editable-dog>what are you up to?
12.03.19 17:43:55<stoopkid> i was looking at web header design articles/videos for a bit but now i'm doing russian homework
12.03.19 17:44:23<editable-dog>nice
12.03.19 17:44:41<editable-dog>i wish i was forced to learn some russian
12.03.19 17:45:48<stoopkid> we could maybe make that happen lol: https://www.freelancer.com/projects/php/project-18932057/?w=f
12.03.19 17:48:02<editable-dog>Surrender to tomorrow until 00:00.
12.03.19 18:55:55<editable-dog>so, i think displaying Things will lend itself well to vue components
12.03.19 18:56:10<editable-dog>one component type for each of constant, variable and bnode
12.03.19 18:56:19<editable-dog>and list
12.03.19 18:57:30<editable-dog>not sure if i want some global or local toggle for displaying things get_valued or not-get_valued
12.03.19 18:58:02<editable-dog>probably would start with just get_valued
13.03.19 12:35:51<stoopkid> gonna start working on a new layout today to test out bootstrap
13.03.19 12:45:41<stoopkid> looks like bootstrap probably makes it pretty easy to put together a simple static but responsive page
13.03.19 14:28:19<stoopkid> so i guess a question is gonna be... how do we actually want to manage the content for the site, independently of any web / design concerns
13.03.19 14:32:53<stoopkid> im getting a bit more comfortable but still several steps away from having a "complete" process
13.03.19 16:26:06<stoopkid> looks like i'll be learning a bit of scss/sass as well
13.03.19 16:35:15<stoopkid> nice: http://jsbin.com/telejidowa/edit?html,css,output
13.03.19 16:36:30<stoopkid> responsively collapses into a hamburger menu for smaller viewports & controls the menu interactivity w/ pure CSS

14.03.19 06:56:54<editable-dog>nice
14.03.19 06:57:10<editable-dog>you're definitely gonna be our design chef
14.03.19 06:57:31<editable-dog>i cant read this stuff
14.03.19 11:05:07<stoopkid> you mean the less stylings? i can't read that yet but i can (mostly) read the CSS it generates
14.03.19 11:07:27<stoopkid> https://materializecss.com/templates/parallax-template/preview.html
14.03.19 11:13:04<stoopkid> i wonder if that parallax effect can work w/ pure CSS
14.03.19 11:17:13<stoopkid> https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/
14.03.19 11:35:36<stoopkid> didn't know CSS supported all this 3D
14.03.19 11:38:52<stoopkid> i'm thinking it'll probably be good to try to stick to pure CSS as much as possible.. i mean we might not have any serious security concerns putting some simple js on some simple static sites but if we can minimize the potential attack surface that'll still be good, plus whenever CSS supports a feature it should be generally simpler to implement, and then it'll still work on browsers w/ js disabled and probably be
                 <stoopkid> easier to integrate w/ accessibility stuff
14.03.19 11:41:06<stoopkid> plus i figure this is just part of what "mastering CSS" entails, cause any serious UI design on web is probably gonna require us getting down into the CSS rather than relying on templates
14.03.19 11:48:22<stoopkid> and i figure we should explicitly be taking a strategy of progressive enhancement.. for a number of reasons,  we explicitly set an expectation of starting small & building up which would be advantageous in our business model, we can hone in on specific smaller things that can actually fit into what these freelancing jobs are paying, and start figuring out what are the increments of functionality we can provide
14.03.19 11:51:09<stoopkid> i think "progressive enhancement" is the buzzword that describes what i had been trying to describe about the business model i was sort of envisioning, except i was applying it much more generally, i.e. to the client's entire business (or our own business) rather than just their website, with a simple website just being one immediate enhancement for a business
14.03.19 11:51:35<stoopkid> for any** business really
14.03.19 11:57:27<stoopkid> so what i'd sort of wanted to do was elaborate on that concept in the same way that we would elaborate on specific software requirement to turn it into a documented implementation/strategy/pattern, that documentation then serving as a sort of outline for how we can present ourselves to clients, i.e. "what is it that we do for you"
14.03.19 12:00:21<stoopkid> so basically like the way we think about building up some entirely arbitrary software from scratch, we should be perhaps thinking more about how to build some entirely arbitrary business from scratch
14.03.19 12:01:19<stoopkid> (this is sort of to elaborate on the "something something business processes" in your "about us" thing heh)
14.03.19 12:03:10<stoopkid> so we're not thinking about just the job per se, we're thinking about their entire business, so ex. "online tutoring site" for $500..
14.03.19 12:03:33<stoopkid> ok so they *said* they want an online tutoring site for $500 but what does that actually mean in "client-ese" ?
14.03.19 12:10:45<stoopkid> could mean like a million things and the client doesn't know what they want and doesn't have a well-thought out business model just a vague idea that they can turn this $500 into more $ if they have some random freelance person prototype their vague idea
14.03.19 12:12:14<stoopkid> so less than thinking "how do implement the thing the client requested", we should be thinking "how do we help the client turn their $500 into more $", ultimately that is the function we're indirectly being paid for on any job
14.03.19 12:14:20<stoopkid> more $ or more "profit" by whatever we can perceive the client's subjective definition of profit to be.. which 99% of the time is gonna be $ ofc, not the kind of.. technological utopianism we would generally prefer
14.03.19 12:23:25<stoopkid> to me this kind of simplifies the whole picture of what we would be building towards, we're basically looking for what are the tech patterns that generalize across arbitrary businesses, ex. *every* business has a website & social media, *every* business employs some form of e-commerce, *every* business shares common schemas of things they need to track in a database, etc.. ex. it's the difference between saying "i know
                 <stoopkid> SQL" vs. "i know CRM/ERP" or "i know full-stack web programming" vs. "i know web design & e-commerce"
14.03.19 12:25:43<stoopkid> so w/ "from english to binary and back, for you" in reality that needs to be more like "from business-ese to binary **and back**, for your business"
14.03.19 12:31:51<stoopkid> so that's more or less what i mean by the business requirements / business processes stuff: how do client businesses generally conceptualize this stuff, and what things do they all objectively need
14.03.19 12:33:16<stoopkid> and ultimately.. we already basically know the answers to this, it's not "hard" we just don't generally think about it so we haven't refined a specific practice around it yet
14.03.19 12:37:13<stoopkid> we've seen businesses and what they do and how they do it it's a bunch of very specific functions/requirements that they all share *prior* to their specialization into what it is they even specifically do as a business, that really aren't ever gonna change because they're entirely human-level things, only the tech-stack implementing these processes is what changes
14.03.19 12:40:59<stoopkid> not that we should be too worried about picking up a new tech-stack but i'd think we kind of want our marketing of ourselves to transcend that and be a human-level thing that can ride on top of the change, but with the same depth of elaboration that we put into the actual software work
14.03.19 12:42:59<stoopkid> ex. we should be thinking as if this is our role : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer#Overview
14.03.19 12:44:43<stoopkid> not that we would necessarily have such an involved role but basically we should just be ready for that, i.e. we should be over-prepared for the depth of involvement we might have
14.03.19 12:52:05<stoopkid> especially since that kind of role is what's gonna be the most highly valued, like as we can see on upwork/freelancer, specific "implement this little component/function or fix this bug" is viewed as basically glorified construction work, notably in terms of pay
14.03.19 13:05:12<stoopkid> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title#Senior_management
14.03.19 13:05:46<stoopkid> so we already have a whole template for what we'd be going for here in terms of the technical implementation of these peoples' job descriptions
14.03.19 13:12:32<stoopkid> now we're quite there yet ofc but that's basically what i mean about applying the "progressive business enhancement" to our own business
14.03.19 13:15:40<stoopkid> so, on a more specific note we should probably quantify a target amount we're aiming for so we can get a better picture of the amount of work we'll need to be taking on?
14.03.19 13:16:13<stoopkid> i'm thinking this needs to be somewhere like at least $4k / month, between the two of us
14.03.19 13:17:41<stoopkid> so that's 16 $250 jobs, 8 $500 jobs, 4 $1000 dollar jobs..
14.03.19 13:18:26<stoopkid> so if we're thinking of taking $250 jobs, we should be thinking, what's a job we actually can do for $250 and fit 16 of them into a month on average
14.03.19 13:18:39<stoopkid> etc..
14.03.19 13:24:13<stoopkid> we might not make that at first for a while but that'll be ok as long as we can narrow down a specific set of things we know we'll be able to do enough of for a realistic amount of $
14.03.19 13:27:06<stoopkid> but relative to what people are paying for the kinds of work that there's a lot of, this is a quite busy schedule at first..
14.03.19 13:29:20<stoopkid> and we should maybe take a short month on that, i.e. assume $4k per 28 days / 4 weeks or $1k a week
14.03.19 13:29:30<stoopkid> actually should maybe be more like $5k considering taxes..
14.03.19 13:31:15<stoopkid> so really a $250 job is something we should be able to do in a day, with only a tiny amount of further support (if any) that wouldn't generally interfere with our work on other days
14.03.19 13:37:15<stoopkid> so on average $250 / weekday.. maybe that's split up so what does a weekday really mean to us.. 8 hours a piece hopefully of solid work on some project, not including any of our work managing our own business stuff (i.e. portfolio/marketing, accounting if needed, dealing with taxes etc.. etc..)
14.03.19 13:43:10<stoopkid> so realistically we should maybe be aiming for something like $25 / man-hour spent actually working on a specific project and at least 5 hours from each of us a weekday, not including looking for more jobs, developing our business etc..

14.03.19 14:41:11<editable-dog>the parallax stuff looks fun, i wonder if anyone has made a game with it yet
14.03.19 14:45:52<stoopkid> you could definitely get pretty close: https://codepen.io/danbhala/pen/GJGQad
14.03.19 14:49:42<stoopkid> you could definitely make something even in pure CSS heh: https://codepen.io/elad2412/pen/hBaqo

14.03.19 15:00:25<stoopkid> https://codepen.io/kowlor/pen/ZYYQoy
14.03.19 15:04:49<editable-dog>not quite what i imagined but crazy still
14.03.19 15:07:05<stoopkid> something like a sonic or icy tower thing with a parallax background?
14.03.19 15:11:05<stoopkid> also how do you feel about using a standard parallax front-page for our site? the parallax front-pages aren't necessarily my favorite thing but they get the job done
14.03.19 15:13:04<editable-dog>so..your math sounds about right, although i think i can probably go quite a bit lower
14.03.19 15:19:11<editable-dog>idk, i find all the animated css stuff laggy and sloppy
14.03.19 15:20:44<stoopkid> what would your number be? i guess mine is ~$2000 / month after taxes & upwork/freelancer fees, i could probably go a bit lower to like $1500 / mo but that wouldn't leave much room for error
14.03.19 15:24:51<editable-dog>in terms of wallet cash, about a minimum,in order to not go all the way to my social case days,about $700
14.03.19 15:25:35<editable-dog>i'd say that be ok as long as the work would be enjoyable and fulfilling
14.03.19 15:26:07<editable-dog>now, i havent really sat down to do the taxes and insurances math yet
14.03.19 15:28:24<editable-dog>but i think at least as long as i have some of that covered by my disability pension, it should be enough if the amount landing in my bank account would be i guess between 1000 and 1200
14.03.19 15:28:29<editable-dog>probably 1000
14.03.19 15:30:20<editable-dog>but..thats like...probably not saving anything, even with the disability pension still coming in
14.03.19 15:32:03<editable-dog>wrt parallax, id say i quite enjoy the basic background images kind, like this http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/
14.03.19 15:32:20<editable-dog>image, not images
14.03.19 15:34:25<stoopkid> right so if we're not saving anything we don't really have any room for error like a month where we only make $500 or w/e.. so our number probably needs to be like $2000 each after taxes
14.03.19 15:36:37<editable-dog>possibly, i dont really know how many errors we intend to make
14.03.19 15:37:39<editable-dog>if it averages to the number i gave, im fine
14.03.19 15:40:03<stoopkid> i figure we should err on the side of caution, i.e. if we aim high we can hope it's high but can probably expect it to average out to our actual number, and be pleasantly surprised if we actually hit our higher goal
14.03.19 15:45:31<editable-dog>well, so far ive applied to these jobs:
                 <editable-dog>scraping DBpedia with some specific fields.
14.03.19 15:45:39<editable-dog>Hourly Rate
                 <editable-dog>Total amount the client will see on your proposal
                 <editable-dog>$15.00/hr
                 <editable-dog>You'll Receive
                 <editable-dog>The estimated amount you'll receive after service fees
14.03.19 15:45:40<editable-dog>$12.00/hr
14.03.19 15:46:16<editable-dog>Hey Sorry Jindrich, we have closed this requirement for now. Thanks for the proposal
14.03.19 15:46:36<editable-dog>QT GUI / HMI programming support.
14.03.19 15:46:51<editable-dog>The estimated amount you'll receive after service fees
14.03.19 15:46:54<editable-dog>$16.00/hr
14.03.19 15:47:36<editable-dog>spent maybe a hour discussing requirements with them, didnt hear from them since friday
14.03.19 15:48:45<editable-dog>then some crap reverse engineering i turned down
14.03.19 15:48:48<editable-dog>eventually
14.03.19 15:49:32<editable-dog>lets see freelancer..
14.03.19 15:50:14<editable-dog>spent quite a bit of time back and forth with this CEGUI guy, eventually turned down his $150 proposal
14.03.19 15:50:43<editable-dog>had 3 shorter interactions that didnt lead anywhere
14.03.19 15:52:05<editable-dog>workana..applied to maybe 3 jobs, didnt go anywhere
14.03.19 15:53:02<editable-dog>but...i think the rates you propose might be realistic, if things take off
14.03.19 15:54:01<editable-dog>err, well, ive applied to many more jobs, i was just going through chat logs here
14.03.19 15:54:23<editable-dog>so, applications where some followup chat happened
14.03.19 15:56:33<stoopkid> i mean, realistically it's dirt cheap relative to the kind of work we would be aiming to do, it's just that it happens to still be enough that we can live on
14.03.19 16:00:04<editable-dog>well your numbers would be reasonable for an estabilished pro i guess
14.03.19 16:01:19<stoopkid> well, exactly, i'm setting the number relative to the least we would want to be expecting after we're fully financially supporting ourselves as established pros in the services we're offering
14.03.19 16:01:58<editable-dog>also, so far, ive been very cautious wrt estimates of time spent on jobs, but that was also because it would mostly have been one-man jobs
14.03.19 16:02:08<editable-dog>yeah
14.03.19 16:05:39<stoopkid> yea a lot of jobs you've been looking at i would probably be getting up to speed on a lot of it on the job.. i'm getting pretty close to having the basic web design stuff ready to go and then i'll probably start applying a lot more, haven't been too comfortable applying to anything that i'm not pretty sure i already know more or less what to do
14.03.19 16:06:26<editable-dog>yeah thats reasonable
14.03.19 16:16:29<stoopkid> so wrt using a simple image parallax on the site would you wanna browse on here a bit for some free stock photos you might want to use? i can maybe have megan take some of our own photos for us at some point
14.03.19 16:18:25<editable-dog>idk, do we want random photos on the background?
14.03.19 16:21:11<stoopkid> not necessarily; some non-random photos/graphics might be nice though if we're showcasing general UI development.. depends what kind of site design we're going for
14.03.19 16:22:14<editable-dog>i think ill leave this up to you now, if you dont mind
14.03.19 16:22:34<editable-dog>kinda busy with a call and pondering another proposal here now
14.03.19 16:23:18<stoopkid> no problem
14.03.19 17:16:31<editable-dog>ok, applied to one underpaid job
14.03.19 17:43:00<editable-dog>haha
14.03.19 17:43:02<editable-dog>https://www.freelancer.com/projects/mysql/need-antivirus-system-like-bit/?w=f
15.03.19 01:28:51<stoopkid> almost got pure css bootstrap responsive navbar w/ parallax layout.. not quite though, still having trouble taking full control over the layout & styling.. might need to find a more complete template but it's hard to find more complete templates that are already pure css, and then that's potentially just more complexity to be trying to take control over..
15.03.19 01:44:01<stoopkid> there's some more complete packages that use js, but probably don't want to be using js frameworks too much at first for simple layout animation if possible, although js graphics frameworks are probably the next thing i want to dive into after basic css sites
15.03.19 01:44:31<stoopkid> unless we land a qt job or something first
15.03.19 01:49:16<stoopkid> well.. maybe.. it would be one logical next step (after learning vue & gridsome etc.. anyway..)
15.03.19 02:06:56<stoopkid> https://github.com/sto0pkid/WebLayouts/tree/master/Template2
15.03.19 02:10:42<stoopkid> one thing i was thinking might be cool but i'm not gonna devote much time to it yet is to work out the geometry to have those circles eclipse perfectly at top of the page after you scroll past the top banner/masthead section and then stick there to turn into a circular logo section of a sticky header
15.03.19 02:13:55<stoopkid> several issues i'm having so far: getting the navigation menu to show up when it shifts to small display mode; it worked in isolation but i'm not sure what caused a problem when trying to integrate it w/ the parallax background
15.03.19 02:15:23<stoopkid> getting general control over the parallax / perspectives stuff is an issue in and of itself
15.03.19 02:19:28<stoopkid> and also having trouble getting control over the general layout of the navbar; i've got about 24 navbar layout permutations (basically just 1 general navbar layout parameterized by various formulaic rearrangements, reflections, inclusions/exclusions of components, etc..) but trying to get it down to where i can just easily pick & choose one and have it just plop in
15.03.19 04:45:32<editable-dog>i dont see any circles
15.03.19 04:45:42<editable-dog>i see the blog post .. nice
15.03.19 04:46:23<stoopkid> what browser?
15.03.19 04:46:29<editable-dog>chrome
15.03.19 04:52:54<stoopkid> ok should be fixed now
15.03.19 04:53:38<editable-dog>ah nice
15.03.19 04:55:31<editable-dog>one issue i see, when i zoom in really hard, the footer starts overlapping the header
15.03.19 05:00:29<editable-dog>when i zoom out to 80% and im scrolled all the way up, a white horizontal line appears roughle between This and is
15.03.19 05:00:39<editable-dog>roughly
15.03.19 05:06:44<stoopkid> good catch, i guess i need to start looking for proper zoom-level responsiveness in particular
15.03.19 05:07:02<stoopkid> can't replicate the white horizontal line on my chrome though
15.03.19 05:11:45<stoopkid> i guess w/ zooming there's a question of whether it should be an absolute zoom, like just magnifying some portion of the default display, or a readability zoom that might change the layout as it increases the size of elements
15.03.19 05:12:42<stoopkid> i guess the latter is what the browser's zoom feature is meant for
15.03.19 05:15:39<editable-dog>so where did you get the code for a navbar that can collapse and expand without js?
15.03.19 05:16:26<editable-dog>yeah zooming always seems to do the latter
15.03.19 05:19:11<stoopkid> http://jsbin.com/telejidowa/edit?html,css,output
15.03.19 05:20:22<stoopkid> this one looks potentially better though: https://jsfiddle.net/viralpatel/2w1owayn/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=2w1owayn
15.03.19 05:34:49<editable-dog>well, i'd say, while i totally feel the same wrt js vs pure, if the bootstrap standard template does it with js, then its a "worldwide" standard, and theres probably no reason to avoid it
15.03.19 05:36:27<editable-dog>so i'd put this feature aside as a nicety
15.03.19 05:50:17<editable-dog>whats the https://jsfiddle.net/viralpatel/2w1
15.03.19 05:50:24<editable-dog>err
15.03.19 05:50:26<editable-dog>whats the
15.03.19 05:50:38<editable-dog>data-toggle="collapse"
15.03.19 05:50:59<editable-dog>in the second one, since it seems it does and should work without it
15.03.19 05:59:30<stoopkid> idk they might just be leaving that in there in case you want to usurp the layout/styling w/ js in some standard way later
15.03.19 06:00:07<editable-dog>ic
15.03.19 06:00:45<stoopkid> it definitely doesn't serve any purpose here that i can see
15.03.19 06:02:14<stoopkid> anyway i got the navbar mostly fixed but w/ a glitch that when you go from large to small display, the menu starts out already expanded, although you can still close & open it after
15.03.19 06:12:57<stoopkid> ok i see what's going on, they both have basically the same behavior in that if you expand in/out while the menu is open, it'll always come back up when you shrink the display until you click the toggle button again, but firefox starts out with it toggled and chrome starts out with it untoggled
15.03.19 07:54:22<editable-dog>webmediaexperts
15.03.19 07:54:23<editable-dog>Hello, It's my honor to work on your project, I'll be happy to create "Client Project Description", as per your description.
15.03.19 08:04:15<stoopkid> tough competition
15.03.19 08:20:27<stoopkid> alright i combined the css navbar w/ the non-parallax layout that the blog post was on and it's better
15.03.19 08:20:59<editable-dog>nice
15.03.19 08:43:20<editable-dog>im continuing my js journey..
15.03.19 09:00:31<stoopkid> i'll probably start mine pretty soon
15.03.19 09:01:31<stoopkid> so far Template4 is the best put together, starting to come close to being able to be a real site
15.03.19 09:03:42<stoopkid> i just smashed the different pages down into sections of one longer main page, which is nice cause it automatically eliminates the majority of the problem of duplicated HTML
15.03.19 09:05:50<editable-dog>so, https://jsfiddle.net/viralpatel/2w1
15.03.19 09:05:54<editable-dog>damn
15.03.19 09:06:00<editable-dog>"single page application"
15.03.19 09:06:20<editable-dog>damn clipboard never works across vms
15.03.19 09:07:21<stoopkid> yes but maybe less "application" and more "page"
15.03.19 09:07:42<stoopkid> (in this case anyway i mean, hehe)
15.03.19 09:08:20<editable-dog>yea lol thats just what they call it
15.03.19 09:12:01<stoopkid> hm i was thinking the term maybe had further implications like actually dynamically rendering content or talking to cloud APIs like an actual application but idk; my mental model for this template is basically just a static online brochure
15.03.19 09:12:44<editable-dog>maybe
15.03.19 09:51:05<stoopkid> well, i guess Template3 & Template4 are both at the same level of completeness but the single-page definitely has the obv advantage for maintainability
15.03.19 10:15:36<stoopkid> any comments/critiques/proposals (other than the zoom thing) for http://loworbit.now.im/web/WebLayouts/Template3/ or  http://loworbit.now.im/web/WebLayouts/Template4/ before i continue trying to design the rest of our site based on this
15.03.19 10:15:48<editable-dog>zoom thing?
15.03.19 10:16:22<stoopkid> layout & text getting screwy cause of browser zoom
15.03.19 10:16:23<editable-dog>SPARQL
15.03.19 10:19:15<editable-dog>well, i have only one complaint
15.03.19 10:19:38<editable-dog>i hate the bootstrap header bar, how it obscures the page
15.03.19 10:19:51<editable-dog>but...its the standard lol
15.03.19 10:20:08<editable-dog>but just maybe..
15.03.19 10:20:33<editable-dog>maybe we want to send the message that thats the kind of things we care about
15.03.19 10:20:52<editable-dog>but it would probably mean doing the whole thing in something else i suppose?
15.03.19 10:22:32<stoopkid> hrm.. probably not
15.03.19 10:23:48<editable-dog>also, can i try to setup a github-pages repo and you could start pushing it there? I suppose i can maybe start tweaking the content already
15.03.19 10:28:31<stoopkid> non-fixed navbar: loworbit.now.im/web/WebLayouts/Template5
15.03.19 10:28:41<stoopkid> and sure
15.03.19 10:28:59<editable-dog>well, loworbit works too i guess
15.03.19 10:29:44<editable-dog>ah, non-fixed works too i guess, or do you see any issues with it?
15.03.19 10:30:34<stoopkid> only that the menu toggle isn't visible
15.03.19 10:30:47<stoopkid> (when you scroll down, i mean)
15.03.19 10:31:13<stoopkid> that can probably be fixed but that would probably be a bit more involved
15.03.19 10:32:45<editable-dog>that would kinda bring the issue back, of obscuring the text
15.03.19 10:34:27<stoopkid> not if it could just slide past the text on the left / right though
15.03.19 10:36:56<editable-dog>what do you mean slide past?
15.03.19 10:39:30<stoopkid> if there's enough room in the left/right margins of the main content for the nav toggle to fit so that it doesn't  overlap any content it just sits in the upper left/right corner of the screen in the margin of the content
15.03.19 10:41:20<editable-dog>ah
15.03.19 10:41:53<editable-dog>well, that might be a good compromise
15.03.19 10:42:40<editable-dog>although nothing beats, at least in the accessibility aspect that im sensitive about, the version where the navigation just slides out of view
15.03.19 10:42:44<editable-dog>so idk
15.03.19 10:44:43<editable-dog>i think id prefer if we keep our own site maximally accessible, and showcase the more mainstream things first on our portfolio page(s)
15.03.19 10:46:36<stoopkid> can you elaborate some on the kind of accessibility you're looking for?
15.03.19 10:49:04<editable-dog>one, the navigation bar can take a significant portion of the screen space when things are zoomed in, like i tend to zoom things sometimes, and i imagine hard-of-sight people might
15.03.19 10:50:18<editable-dog>two, the standard way to scroll a page down, ie spacebar or pagedown key, scroll by the whole height of the page, including the top bar. Thats really my biggest issue
15.03.19 10:51:07<editable-dog>so if you just press pagedown, one or more lines that were previously under the screen edge get covered by the bar
15.03.19 10:53:28<editable-dog>sure, these arent significant issues, maybe not issues at all
15.03.19 10:53:57<editable-dog>more of ergonomics/annoyance rather than accessibility
15.03.19 10:54:16<stoopkid> so you're saying that if you page down, something that was below the bottom might end up above the top and so the user misses it?
15.03.19 10:54:42<editable-dog>it ends up hidden by the nav bar
15.03.19 10:54:48<editable-dog>go try it
15.03.19 10:55:26<editable-dog>hey, it actually works correctly here
15.03.19 10:56:01<editable-dog>awesome
15.03.19 10:56:51<stoopkid> heh, well cool, yea it doesn't seem to end up hidden for me either
15.03.19 10:58:07<editable-dog>im so used to this happening everywhere that i didnt even really check
15.03.19 10:59:07<editable-dog>so, firefox even does the correct thing and if you have just a half of a line visible at the bottom and scroll, it brings the whole line to view 
15.03.19 10:59:24<editable-dog>chrome merely scrolls by the content area width
15.03.19 11:00:09<stoopkid> i don't usually scroll that way i swipe the touch-pad so i haven't ever really seen it or looked for it, do you have an example site where it happens? i wonder what's done differently to make it work correctly
15.03.19 11:00:44<editable-dog>lets see, maybe its a browser thing and i wont be able to find any examples now..
15.03.19 11:03:02<editable-dog>so, different issue i believe, but on https://twitter.com/Twitter if you zoom in enough to bring out the horizontal scroll bar, then its height isnt accounted for
15.03.19 11:03:55<editable-dog>https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html
15.03.19 11:06:10<editable-dog>again only at higher zoom, although horiizontal scroolbar doesnt need to appear, and the content doesnt seem to run by by the entire height of the nav bar
15.03.19 11:06:23<editable-dog>overrun
15.03.19 11:06:54<editable-dog>https://www.linkedin.com/company/intel-corporation
15.03.19 11:06:56<editable-dog>bad
15.03.19 11:07:27<editable-dog>nvm i think that's the h scrollbar again
15.03.19 11:14:15<editable-dog>nope, cant find it anywhere now
15.03.19 11:14:23<editable-dog>kinda nice: http://www.jorgerigabert.com/
15.03.19 11:14:47<editable-dog>just doesnt work
15.03.19 11:15:35<stoopkid> you mean as a model for our site? cause it looks like it's functioning reasonably well
15.03.19 11:15:57<editable-dog>nothing happens when i click the side buttons
15.03.19 11:16:19<stoopkid> ah they work for me, i wonder what's broken for you
15.03.19 11:16:20<editable-dog>not that i'd ever think to click them, normally
15.03.19 11:17:04<stoopkid> did you try firefox? seems to be a chrome thing
15.03.19 11:17:06<editable-dog>ah i have noscript in this browser
15.03.19 11:17:15<editable-dog>yeah works in firefox
15.03.19 11:18:43<editable-dog>mm yeah chrome thing
15.03.19 11:20:13<stoopkid> so you prefer the side nav over the banner nav?
15.03.19 11:20:27<editable-dog>not really
15.03.19 11:20:38<editable-dog>i prefer a get-out-of-my-way nav 
15.03.19 11:20:44<editable-dog>but idk
15.03.19 11:20:52<stoopkid> heh, gotcha
15.03.19 11:22:08<stoopkid> well, i will say at least that on our simple site a fixed header nav is definitely overkill, like we don't have a million options you need to quickly navigate from anywhere
15.03.19 11:22:20<stoopkid> basically just scrolling from one side of a brochure to the other
15.03.19 11:29:16<editable-dog>so, i did a quick scan of local job board for part-time programming positions, and there are quite a few now, nice
15.03.19 11:29:43<editable-dog>not that i'd be giving our plan up already
15.03.19 11:30:16<editable-dog>just figured i'd look if there isnt something super awesome available
15.03.19 11:30:58<stoopkid> options are always good
15.03.19 11:31:05<editable-dog>im not sure, but i dont think there were as many part time positions before
15.03.19 11:31:37<editable-dog>definitely gives me little more peace of mind
15.03.19 11:33:47<stoopkid> wrt local part-time/full-time programming positions there's never been much of a shortage around here, relative to some basic effort on my part to actually put myself in position for them
15.03.19 11:36:05<stoopkid> so i guess i haven't been all that worried wrt having that as a fallback option
15.03.19 11:38:55<stoopkid> especially if we already have some basics to show like a well-designed portfolio site hooked up to as comprehensive of a tech/business stack as we can come up with to showcase while we're looking for (hopefully getting) some jobs.. i figure that'll be plenty to show some prospective employers around here
15.03.19 11:39:25<editable-dog>theres deff no shortage of fulltime positions here, but with part time, the number of available choices goes way down 
15.03.19 13:31:40<stoopkid> https://software-for-immortality.github.io
15.03.19 13:39:03<editable-dog>nice
15.03.19 13:39:35<editable-dog>now, though, what about the blog-like section? it should get its own page i guess
15.03.19 13:42:31<stoopkid> the blog is gonna be a little more involved that's the only reason i took it out for now, i.e. it didn't make as much sense for this simple one-page site template, and yea i figure it could get its own separate page
15.03.19 13:45:21<editable-dog>well, with vue this could be like a subpage but within the SPA
15.03.19 13:45:23<stoopkid> although it could; we could reasonably have a one-page blog, i guess it's not even a drastically different model than this one-page site template i already put up there, just many more sections with proper formatting
15.03.19 13:46:17<editable-dog>yeah im all for one-page-blog, just on a different page than this one:)
15.03.19 13:48:43<editable-dog>probably we should then really consider keeping the content in md files tho
15.03.19 14:59:29<stoopkid> so probably the gridsome-starter-markdown-blog ?
15.03.19 15:19:57<editable-dog>i guess
16.03.19 17:25:23<editable-dog>ugh, i just spent so much time debugging such a stupid thing
16.03.19 17:26:37<editable-dog>i think i already spent so long yesterday debugging a first thing, sort of an oversight in my design or maybe just forgot to finish some changes, not sure
16.03.19 17:27:19<editable-dog>so today morning i fixed it, and then i spend so much time again bringing the other code up to date with the change
16.03.19 17:28:31<editable-dog>like...at some point, i drop all my attention down into the code, and then when i finish something and something still doesnt work, instead of backing up to ponder the design, im hopelessly lost in the code
16.03.19 17:28:53<editable-dog>and have to debug my way to figuring out where i overlooked something in the design
16.03.19 17:30:17<editable-dog>and i stay stuck in this tunnel vision and have to painfully debug what i might otherwise realize simply by looking at the control flow
16.03.19 17:30:34<editable-dog>we really should work together more closely
16.03.19 17:31:56<editable-dog>days like these i feel so dumb
16.03.19 23:47:34<stoopkid> yea
16.03.19 23:48:07<stoopkid> that's kinda how i feel right now after starting to actually get the picture wrt how gridsome works
16.03.19 23:51:34<stoopkid> and yea probably wouldn't have been stuck on so many basics if i had been going over it w/ you, but then otoh didn't wanna waste your time on real basic stuff that i'd know if i'd just gone through a tutorial
17.03.19 03:37:00<stoopkid> alright i'm getting a pretty good handle on gridsome & vue now
17.03.19 03:39:36<stoopkid> i guess more gridsome than vue really
17.03.19 03:41:09<stoopkid> w/ vue i basically understand the parts that you do in gridsome, but i haven't experimented much with using vue outside of gridsome or how to properly make a from-scratch vue application
17.03.19 03:41:52<stoopkid> but at least the 3-part .vue file syntax and all the v-if, v-for, v-html stuff..
17.03.19 03:51:04<stoopkid> pretty straightforward now that i'm getting the hang of it, i guess it was slightly overwhelming at first being confronted simultaneously with Vue, GraphQL and Gridsome's particulars when i was still just trying to refresh my memory on JS/Node.js/HTML/CSS
17.03.19 03:51:48<stoopkid> and getting acquainted w/ modern web expectations
17.03.19 04:35:45<editable-dog>yeah, thats how i felt the first time, why i went back to just vue
17.03.19 04:35:55<editable-dog>alright, doing anything now?
17.03.19 05:00:47<stoopkid> just finished up a gridsome tutorial on how to make a markdown blog, but i probably should be in bed lol
17.03.19 05:01:51<stoopkid> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF3K3IpRfhE
17.03.19 05:02:07<stoopkid> made less than 2 weeks ago heh
17.03.19 05:04:04<stoopkid> my overall impression after going through this tutorial: gridsome/graphql/vue are pretty cool, i kinda hope this takes off
17.03.19 05:17:18<stoopkid> later maybe we can go through building a blog-site together and then hopefully have as a result of that a basic prototype for our portfolio site and then i can just work on styling it?
17.03.19 05:21:17<stoopkid> hm, one thing i notice about gridsome is that it dynamically renders everything
17.03.19 05:21:37<stoopkid> ah hrm
17.03.19 05:31:11<stoopkid> ah lol, it's because the stylesheet file is "/assets/..." which when viewing locally my computer interprets as an absolute file-path..
17.03.19 05:35:48<editable-dog>can you set it up on azure tomorrow?
17.03.19 05:37:11<editable-dog>the new vps
17.03.19 05:37:22<stoopkid> sure
17.03.19 06:53:01<editable-dog>got turned down on another job because i dont have django experience
17.03.19 06:58:16<editable-dog>idk how you feel on node vs python once we get to some backending
17.03.19 06:59:04<editable-dog>node has obvious advantages, but getting django under my belt would probably be fairly quick

17.03.19 20:06:53<stoopkid> hm maybe
17.03.19 20:10:38<stoopkid> wrt nodejs vs python on backend i figured i was gonna start w/ nodejs but i figured eventually i was gonna master python for backend too
17.03.19 20:12:01<stoopkid> mainly just cause everything i'm already working w/ uses node so i figured i should get a handle on that while it's immediately relevant to what i'm doing
17.03.19 20:20:50<stoopkid> im maybe a bit iffy about the hourly work over upwork/freelancer but idk, the mapping job definitely looks interesting and is probably relatively approachable but idk if i'm quite where i want to be w/ that
17.03.19 20:26:06<stoopkid> it's ultimately probably about the same amount of complexity as just getting solid on this standard modern web stuff, which i'm gonna say is realistically probably a couple weeks of just getting up to speed to be producing professional quality results efficiently
17.03.19 20:27:36<stoopkid> we could probably do that job but we can already know right now that we would be very inefficient and many of those hours would be spent w/ us just getting a handle on the frameworks, the data and the map design
17.03.19 20:29:14<editable-dog>i guess thats right, depends on wether its something we want to learn anyway or not
17.03.19 20:31:57<stoopkid> it's something i'm interested in learning but this is maybe a more in depth job than i would want to jump into for my first experiments with it; if we had a simpler web gig and somebody just wanted it to show something simple like their store location on google maps that would be more of something to start w/ unless we did our own experimentation on the side, but that wouldn't be any particular priority for me
17.03.19 20:32:34<editable-dog>fair fair
17.03.19 20:37:43<stoopkid> something like this if we were more ready for app dev: https://www.freelancer.com/projects/php/Fresh-WEBSITE-plus-Apps-for/?w=f
17.03.19 20:41:48<stoopkid> https://www.freelancer.com/projects/graphic-design/Finish-website-18971302/?w=f
17.03.19 20:53:58<stoopkid> so the way i'm figuring it.. over the course 1-2 years we could have the majority of the major web languages & frameworks under our belts and then just be at the point of fine-tuning, so i'm not really picky about what we learn other than that ideally for me would find a way to integrate all the things we do into basically just being one thing, like we have relative proficiency in many different systems but each of
17.03.19 20:53:59<stoopkid> those skills is kind of silo-ed into its own space not like integrated into a complete package
17.03.19 21:06:13<stoopkid> i figure anything that we're gonna try to focus down on like "this should be 'the' thing" should be a human-level thing not a particular framework/lang, ex. "typography & graphic design", as opposed to "HTML / CSS" etc.. with the expectation that the frameworks/langs are gonna change, probably every couple of years or so
17.03.19 21:12:19<stoopkid> not as like a strict rule or anything i just figure that's where our general mindset & marketing should be
17.03.19 21:15:56<editable-dog>probably
17.03.19 21:27:29<editable-dog>im gonna go to bed "early" today
17.03.19 21:29:31<editable-dog>im starting to feel tired of this idea of working for somebody else
17.03.19 21:31:53<stoopkid> as opposed to say owning software IP or crowdfunding your own ideas
17.03.19 21:32:11<editable-dog>yeah
17.03.19 21:33:51<stoopkid> seems like that's the only alternative to working for somebody else though?
17.03.19 21:35:23<editable-dog>idk, in theory i could take a year of time to build an app
17.03.19 21:35:58<editable-dog>but idk, your plan is probably the wise middle road
17.03.19 21:39:12<stoopkid> yea it's just a lot of eggs to put in a fairly risky basket that could potentially leave us back at square 1 if it flops for whatever reason, and also doesn't have much opportunity to start getting paid sooner than that
17.03.19 21:43:31<stoopkid> also we could design some kind of application around the kind of work that's actually readily available and build it up over time, that would be a much less risky basket
17.03.19 21:44:08<editable-dog>yeah
17.03.19 21:46:06<stoopkid> like at the very least if you wanted to build ex. an android app we should probably get ourselves equipped to be able to market ourselves as android app devs & designers before we actually set forth to really invest in building our own android app
17.03.19 21:52:51<stoopkid> so i mean it's something we could totally fit in to our schedule & business model but we can do it in a risk-minimizing way (which i kinda figure might actually improve the results with the actual app)
17.03.19 21:58:27<stoopkid> but otoh i'm generally uncomfortable w/ the proprietary sw model anyway.. what i would potentially be more comfortable w/ though is if we had proprietary sw but crowd-funding to open-source it
17.03.19 22:00:44<stoopkid> like i just want to be paid for performing the dev service so that i can support myself for more dev services, not get paid just for property ownership
17.03.19 22:06:04<stoopkid> the way i'm looking at it, after basic web dev we're in a position to go pretty much any direction in just a couple logical steps
17.03.19 22:11:01<stoopkid> so if you have a specific app idea in mind that you wanna aim for i'd at least be open to developing in that direction, incrementally
18.03.19 03:39:40<editable-dog>if you mean you dont want to get rich, its ok, i can keep all the money
18.03.19 03:39:44<editable-dog>j/k
18.03.19 03:40:19<editable-dog>well first i have to have the cnl system ready..
18.03.19 03:41:42<editable-dog>seriously though, what i described earlier, the open source core + proprieatary addons + "proprietary" packaging and distribution etc, seems to be a standard way
18.03.19 03:42:24<editable-dog>along with "proprietary" support service, to sustain any business around open source software
18.03.19 03:44:15<editable-dog>id be open to try other models like crowdfunding, tho
18.03.19 04:58:02<editable-dog>Hi.. thanks for responding..
18.03.19 04:58:04<editable-dog>I have the UI layout and the functionality for the visiting card type of canvas. It is buggy.. as described in the project description
                 <editable-dog>Uses Django...
                 <editable-dog>L
                 <editable-dog>Currently the app is not hosted..
18.03.19 04:58:05<editable-dog>so, you only need the fix/datastructure redesign? Can we see the code?
                 <editable-dog>hi there
                 <editable-dog>16 MAR 2019 · 7:33 AM
18.03.19 04:58:06<editable-dog>Yes. Mainly it is a data structure redesign. I will get it hosted and share the link with you.
                 <editable-dog>L
                 <editable-dog>koo5 - have you worked with frameworks?
18.03.19 04:58:07<editable-dog>Honestly i have more experience in systems programming and desktop apps, but now me and my teammate have decided to start doing web seriously. He has more frontend experience, and i am learning one frontend framework . So it may take us a bit of time to understand django code. But i know enough of the principles.
                 <editable-dog>18 MAR 2019 · 7:30 AM
                 <editable-dog>sounds good.. if you are up to it, will award it to you.. pl take a look at canva.com visiting card design template for somewhat a reference.
                 <editable-dog>We use Django framework..
                 <editable-dog>L
                 <editable-dog>I think you must be able to code since you are working on semantic web. But you have no reviews.. let me know if you are up to it. I am just getting the hosting ready
                 <editable-dog>L
                 <editable-dog>ok, i played with canva.com, nice app
                 <editable-dog>yes, we can indeed code, and i think we are up to it:)
18.03.19 04:58:14<editable-dog>in the unlikely case that we find we are not up to it, we can let you know quickly and you can hire someone else
18.03.19 13:33:41<stoopkid> cool
18.03.19 13:33:50<stoopkid> can you link the original job listing?
18.03.19 14:13:26<stoopkid> "if you mean you dont want to get rich" depends on the definition of "rich"
18.03.19 14:18:32<stoopkid> like for most people "rich" means owning some property that continues to earn you profit so that you can escape the world of the plebs and have them do your bidding
18.03.19 14:18:51<stoopkid> doesn't interest me at all
18.03.19 14:19:48<stoopkid> like i don't measure my personal richness in terms of my ability to coerce others into my service
18.03.19 14:22:38<stoopkid> for me "rich" would mean just having enough success in a service-oriented business model so that i could have some legitimacy in arguing against capitalism & intellectual property rights and in favor of universal basic income..
18.03.19 14:31:26<stoopkid> i mean, i'm not opposed to doing it, but it's definitely not my long-term goal for how i'd want to financially support myself
18.03.19 14:47:34<stoopkid> anyway, i've been looking into accessibility for screen-readers and keyboard navigation.. in some ways i kind of like this version of web-navigation even better, like it's a very algorithmic approach to UI interaction.. reminds me of doing text-manipulation by keyboard shortcuts in vim
18.03.19 14:48:49<stoopkid> who would've thought web-accessibility for the blind would be so 1337
18.03.19 14:55:02<stoopkid> i was starting to think that my pure HTML/CSS stuff was a bit pedantic but apparently that's not even minimalist enough.. apparently progressive enhancement is supposed to start at pure HTML5 and CSS is just an enhancement for seeing users, i.e. none of the basic functionality for the site should even be dependent on CSS
18.03.19 14:57:23<stoopkid> i've been playing around w/ js disabled but i didn't even realize til last night that browsers have options to turn off CSS

18.03.19 15:35:31<stoopkid> cool yea if we have 2 months to finish it it looks like probably a piece of cake
18.03.19 16:27:12<stoopkid> i guess wrt doing our own app & doing it on a proprietary model, i'm open to it but i'd probably have you take the lead on it, like i don't have any particular app that would be like my "dream app" to work on, i just want to code whatever.. could be for somebody else, could be for our own app, doesn't really matter much to me as long as we have a profit model around it and are doing high-quality reusable work
18.03.19 16:32:42<stoopkid> i guess i should say "professional" quality.. our work is generally "high" quality but i'd say it's generally not "professional" quality.. not sure if you'd agree w/ that characterization
18.03.19 16:41:20<stoopkid> like idk, it seems like you have way more specific ideas in mind for what you want to be working on whereas i'm coming from kind of the opposite position of trying to figure out what i can work on that doesn't really require me to have any specific idea in mind, i.e. specifically seeking out the lowest common denominator stuff that's pretty much universally in constant demand
18.03.19 16:44:55<stoopkid> so i mean my specific ideas at this stage are just simple things like "i want my websites to be perfectly navigable by keyboard or screen-reader", "i want my websites to be zoom-responsive", "i want locally-hosted WYSIWYG CMS for static site generation", etc..
18.03.19 17:38:08<editable-dog>actually thats really hard to judge, wrt professionality of our work
18.03.19 17:38:50*** Quit: sirccloud (uid172590@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-xcbykbbvlgozqscl) left #atlas-project: Quit: Connection closed for inactivity
18.03.19 17:58:21<stoopkid> i guess the criteria i'm going by for any given work is that all the standard bells/whistles are included and the some set of best practices are followed (ex. if we're designing a web page, is it responsive? is it accessible? does it have effective layout?), that including these things does not seriously impact our performance (ex. we might know how to write "high-quality" code for the core component of the application
                 <stoopkid> but how hard will it be for us to fit that component into a fully-featured application?), and that we don't need the client to hold our hand through the process of including these things (i.e. in web design they should get a responsive accessible design by default without having to explicitly write this into their specifications), etc..
18.03.19 18:09:27<stoopkid> like idk, when i say "professional quality" i'm not implying some "higher" high quality, it's an independent dimension
18.03.19 18:18:57<stoopkid> so ex.. do we do "professional quality" web design? no way
18.03.19 18:20:07<stoopkid> we might do some "high" quality HTML/CSS/JS components, potentially higher quality than most "professionals" are capable of, but are we "ready to go" on all the "standard" things that every "professional" would include? no way
18.03.19 18:24:48<stoopkid> so i mean think of all the web-devs out there who have 1/10th of the programming capabilities that either of us have in our little toes, but they can still run circles around us when it comes to pushing out a fully-featured site with all the standard bells & whistles and don't need the client to explicitly walk them through those standard requirements
18.03.19 18:28:05<editable-dog>ok, well, when i think professional quality, i think clarity of code, security, having big picture in mind, etc
18.03.19 18:28:37<editable-dog>iow, we can still push out a professional quality website, we're just gonna have to acquire a lot of domain knowledge along the way, so it will take us a lot longer
18.03.19 18:30:23<editable-dog>and wrt that, id like to start using "professional quality" in the sense of code clarity, in our projects
18.03.19 18:31:27<stoopkid> i guess "readiness for a given domain" more closely describes what i'm trying to get at than "professional quality"
18.03.19 18:33:34<editable-dog>what were we talking about anyway?
18.03.19 18:35:22<stoopkid> you wanting to do our own app and me elaborating on how i might want to approach that if we decided to pursue it
18.03.19 18:37:44<editable-dog>ah
18.03.19 18:37:56<editable-dog>yea i do have this vision wrt to cnl ui
18.03.19 18:38:53<stoopkid> so wrt that, for example "well first i have to have the cnl system ready.." is almost exactly opposite of how i'd want to approach it
18.03.19 18:39:59<stoopkid> that would be more like what i would do last
18.03.19 18:50:04<stoopkid> like, how many domains is the cnl stuff gonna be building on? if we were to build this cnl then hypothetically we should be able to get the point of having relative expertise in each domain involved, and then we can be pretty confident that this expertise is gonna be more universally applicable than the end-result app that makes use of it
18.03.19 18:56:48<editable-dog>what i meant was that we'd first have to have the parser/engine working, and demonstrated working for example fast enough, before we could responsibly put our eggs into that basket, since beyond that it would be all easy predictable work
18.03.19 18:57:12<editable-dog>until then, its research and we cant be sure where it will go
18.03.19 18:58:12<editable-dog>this also applies to covering bases
18.03.19 18:58:36<editable-dog>we've already covered a lot of bases, but we cant be sure where it will force us to look next
18.03.19 19:01:26<stoopkid> hm, idk, let's say for example you wanted to build it as an android app; if we were trying to prototype the CNL before just being generally ready in the domain of android apps, that would be an extremely major red flag for me
18.03.19 19:05:46<editable-dog>well, thats why i said "first id need to have the cnl ready", because we need to have a distinction between whats our(my) personal and what we are doing as a business
18.03.19 19:07:22<editable-dog>we shouldnt treat it as a business plan before that
18.03.19 19:10:13<editable-dog>otoh, i am likely to always be putting some energy into it
18.03.19 19:10:55<editable-dog>but not as a priority, because that would be unsustainable
18.03.19 19:13:22<stoopkid> gotcha, ok i think we're on the same page then. if you have specific things that we can start incorporating into the business plan that would get us successively closer to being ready for tackling that project, i'm totally open to prioritizing those things.. ultimately i think which direction we go matters less than just picking some directions, sticking to them, and not getting too ahead of ourselves
18.03.19 19:28:20<editable-dog>ill definitely be looking out for opportunities
18.03.19 19:30:18<editable-dog>hmm, we should get our (sleep) schedules more synchronized, but i dont want screw up mine
18.03.19 19:31:25<editable-dog>i showed up late tonight, but do you think in general you'd be able to start showing up earlier?
18.03.19 19:31:55<editable-dog>so we can actually get down to some hacking too
18.03.19 19:32:30<editable-dog>because right now im ready to call it a day
18.03.19 19:33:23<editable-dog>guess im getting old
18.03.19 19:35:48<stoopkid> yea i've been planning on getting my sleep schedule to where i'm waking up at 5 (my time) but i've been having trouble cause my sleep schedule is already so screwed up and worse most of my productivity comes at night time
18.03.19 19:36:34<editable-dog>5pm?
18.03.19 19:36:56<stoopkid> am heh
18.03.19 19:37:25<editable-dog>why so drastically early
18.03.19 19:37:48<editable-dog>i mean, besides all the obvious good reasons
18.03.19 19:38:37<editable-dog>yeah same with night time productivity
18.03.19 19:38:52<stoopkid> so that you don't have to be up til midnight for us to be able to work a full day together heh
18.03.19 19:39:41<editable-dog>is it 19 over there now?
18.03.19 19:40:02<stoopkid> yea
18.03.19 19:40:32<editable-dog>so 5 hours shift in winter
18.03.19 19:42:22<editable-dog>well i cant bring myself to any work before the noon, so if you show up at 7pm, taht would be like the earliest reasonable optimal time
18.03.19 19:43:22<editable-dog>but if you show up even a few hours later, that should still work very well
18.03.19 19:45:21<editable-dog>well, or if you'd prefer to keep your schedule shifted into the night, i could try getting up early
18.03.19 19:46:18<editable-dog>iow i can try getting up at 5 hehe
18.03.19 19:47:24<stoopkid> nah megan would hate me if we did that lol, 7 works
18.03.19 19:48:22<editable-dog>you mean if i then kept you up until your morning or beyond? yeah i can imagine
18.03.19 19:52:32<stoopkid> yea she would really prefer if i was on approximately the 9-5 working schedule and it sounds like that work well for you too, and i don't really have any particular preference so..
18.03.19 19:53:02<stoopkid> my current schedule is less a matter of preference and more a matter of lack of self-discipline heh.. not good
18.03.19 19:56:01<stoopkid> so i'll aim for being ready to go at ~9 tomorrow and then i'll try to work that down to ~7
18.03.19 19:57:31<stoopkid> i need like 2 hours in the morning for my brain to actually turn on tho so that still amounts to waking up at 5 lol
18.03.19 20:00:28<editable-dog>well it would do me good to have to get up real early have afternoon/evening free like normal people too, my current usual schedule also isnt optimal for me, but the downside for you would obviously be much bigger than the upside for me, i guess
18.03.19 20:00:46<editable-dog>anyway
18.03.19 20:00:56<editable-dog>just 5 hours and such a problem, lol
18.03.19 20:05:27<stoopkid> going even earlier wouldn't be a downside for me really so if you'd prefer to start earlier i can aim for that
18.03.19 20:13:25<editable-dog>if you'd be ready at 6, then we could put in 6 hours before the distractors start pouring in here
18.03.19 20:14:32<editable-dog>that would be your noon, then you could go have lunch with megan if she didnt work all the way downtown
18.03.19 20:15:42<editable-dog>then things get quiet here around 22 my time, and thats exactly when you should go socialize
18.03.19 20:17:07<editable-dog>and then when you get back to the computer i should go sleep
18.03.19 20:18:14<editable-dog>so...i guess we'll aim for the six hours in the morning
18.03.19 20:19:35<editable-dog>idk
18.03.19 20:19:50<editable-dog>i can think in the morning just fine, problem is, i dont want to
18.03.19 20:20:43<editable-dog>so if i get driven into doign something together, it would work i think
18.03.19 20:21:35<stoopkid> heh, well, it sounds fine to me.. we can aim for that and then adjust to start later if we decide we want to
18.03.19 20:28:00<editable-dog>ok
18.03.19 20:28:19<editable-dog>take your time to adjust lol, dont worry if it doesnt work out tomorrow
18.03.19 20:29:10<editable-dog>i think im gonna be babysitting and going to doctors anyway...
18.03.19 20:30:17<stoopkid> alright sounds like a plan; i guess i'm gonna head off and socialize for a bit so i don't get myself absorbed in something and end up staying up til 6 heh
18.03.19 20:30:30<editable-dog>lol ok
18.03.19 20:31:13<editable-dog>alright see you tomorrow then
18.03.19 20:33:40<editable-dog>say hi to megan, i didnt send my congratulations earlier, so...
18.03.19 20:34:22<editable-dog>give her my congratulations i guess, or something
19.03.19 04:54:53<stoopkid> alright, i'm ready-ish
19.03.19 04:55:13<stoopkid> not sure if my brain's all the way on yet but we'll see
19.03.19 04:56:34<editable-dog>yo
19.03.19 04:56:55<editable-dog>ok, so we wanna play with gridsome?
19.03.19 04:57:27<stoopkid> sure, new vps?
19.03.19 04:57:34<editable-dog>yeah
19.03.19 04:57:44<editable-dog>its not even 5 over there, i feel ya
19.03.19 04:59:06<editable-dog>hmm can you paste the ssh line for me?
19.03.19 04:59:42<stoopkid> "ssh sfi@51.140.155.227"
19.03.19 05:00:04<editable-dog>thx
19.03.19 05:00:14<editable-dog>ok let me do those updates and reboot it
19.03.19 05:01:12<editable-dog>did you get gridsome there...or we did?
19.03.19 05:03:10<stoopkid> yea i think we got it set up when we were gonna replicate joe's gardening service
19.03.19 05:03:20<editable-dog>im in tmux
                 <stoopkid> but i haven't touched it since then
19.03.19 05:04:14<editable-dog>so we wanna set up our own blog now?
19.03.19 05:06:09<stoopkid> sure, i figure we'd just use one of their two markdown starter blogs as a template and see what we might want to make out of it
19.03.19 05:09:28<editable-dog>yeah ok
19.03.19 05:26:57<editable-dog>ok firewall opened
19.03.19 05:29:29<editable-dog>http://51.140.155.227/
19.03.19 05:31:21<editable-dog>i guess we're gonna use github pages to host our thing?
19.03.19 05:31:38<editable-dog>should probably try out netlify first just to see what we can offer clients
19.03.19 05:33:44<editable-dog>i wonder how hard does this thing want to live in the webserver root
19.03.19 05:34:28<stoopkid> yea i was wondering that as well
19.03.19 05:34:41<stoopkid> not sure if there's some config setting you can change for that
19.03.19 05:41:28<editable-dog>buuut, i guess after all we want the blog integrated into the rest of the site
19.03.19 05:41:43<editable-dog>like, it should be one item in the navbar
19.03.19 05:42:48<editable-dog>buut, it shouldnt pollute the top level directory with individual blog post dirs
19.03.19 05:43:47<stoopkid> hrm..
19.03.19 05:44:42<stoopkid> maybe we can just make a subdirectory of the gridsome directory mirroring whatever document root we want to deploy it under
19.03.19 05:45:34<editable-dog>i dont follow
19.03.19 05:47:54<stoopkid> well it does everything relative to the webserver root so pages/Index.vue translates to "mysite.com/index.html" so if we want the site to deploy under "mysite.com/gridsome/" maybe we can just throw everything under a pages/gridsome directory and hopefully gridsome would route it properly
19.03.19 05:49:08<stoopkid> side-note: netlify looks pretty trivial
19.03.19 05:49:44<editable-dog>ok, that alllmost worked
19.03.19 05:53:01<editable-dog>there's https://gridsome.org/docs/config/#pathprefix but thats for the whole gridsome site
19.03.19 05:57:09<stoopkid> isn't that what we were looking for?
19.03.19 06:00:02<editable-dog>i suppose we want to have the whole site be a SPA, with the blog main page being just one of the site's pages
19.03.19 06:02:22<editable-dog>it should get built into like /AboutUs, /Blog/index.html, /Blog/...
19.03.19 06:04:58<editable-dog>this src/index.html file seems to go through some templating engine, but not the vue component templeate style one
19.03.19 06:08:16<stoopkid> what did you set to have it build index.html into the blog directory
19.03.19 06:10:03<editable-dog>mmm
19.03.19 06:15:48<stoopkid> ok cool that all seems to make sense
19.03.19 06:18:21<editable-dog>yeah?
19.03.19 06:22:37<editable-dog>cant say it makes sense to me but it seems to do what we want now
19.03.19 06:28:13<editable-dog>grabbing another coffee
19.03.19 06:29:21<stoopkid> well i'm not sure exactly how it makes use of src/index.html, doesn't seem to be in their basic documentation for the src directory structure, but it seems to be using it as a global template for all of the pages, but other than that it's all working as expected
19.03.19 06:30:56<stoopkid> i wonder if gridsome can build and develop at the same time
19.03.19 06:32:19<stoopkid> ah i see you tried that in the other window
19.03.19 06:41:15<stoopkid> ok nvm: https://gridsome.org/docs/overriding-index
19.03.19 06:41:46<stoopkid> so it's all seems to be making sense
19.03.19 06:45:10<editable-dog>ok yeah that makes sense, you simply need some pure html page to include the vue stuff in
19.03.19 06:47:40<editable-dog>ok gridsome develop needed a restart after changing the config file
19.03.19 06:48:21<editable-dog>so, now we integrate your awesome navigation or does gridsome provide something to that effect?
19.03.19 06:49:26<editable-dog>london time hehe
19.03.19 06:49:30<editable-dog>hows the latency for you?
19.03.19 06:49:54<stoopkid> working pretty well for me, how bout you?
19.03.19 06:49:56<editable-dog>its seamless for me
19.03.19 06:50:08<stoopkid> yea same
19.03.19 06:50:12<editable-dog>cool
19.03.19 06:51:38<stoopkid> i think the only things gridsome provides to that kind of effect is whatever's in their starter kits, so we would  use this in conjunction with some actual layout/styling system like bootstrap or w/e
19.03.19 06:52:16<editable-dog>ok cool
19.03.19 06:57:27<stoopkid> wanna start with this one and we can just modify it to have a link to the blog we probably don't need to really display anything about the blog on the main page except a link to it
19.03.19 06:57:58<stoopkid> err, this one: http://loworbit.now.im/web/WebLayouts/Template5/
19.03.19 06:59:28<editable-dog>yeah 
19.03.19 07:03:49<editable-dog>we might want to extract the navigation stuff into a vue component
19.03.19 07:04:02<editable-dog>idk
19.03.19 07:05:23<stoopkid> do you wanna keep the night mode thing
19.03.19 07:05:47<editable-dog>idk, its kinda cool
19.03.19 07:06:05<editable-dog>i wannt move the code into its own file tho
19.03.19 07:06:08<stoopkid> and yea i figured we might also do that with the individual sections so we can just plop them into other pages later
19.03.19 07:17:02<editable-dog>does the order of the css links matter?
19.03.19 07:17:26<editable-dog>dunno how to deal with the bootstrap link, prolly leave it there
19.03.19 07:18:22<stoopkid> we should probably try it like here first and see what happens: https://gridsome.org/docs/head
19.03.19 07:32:40<editable-dog>hmm, i think im fine with the hardcoded link for now
19.03.19 07:47:34<editable-dog>Refused to apply style from 'http://localhost:8080/style.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.
19.03.19 07:47:39<editable-dog>i dont get where this is coming from
19.03.19 07:52:00<stoopkid> sorry got pulled away
19.03.19 07:52:24<editable-dog>ah that's just gridsome develop needing to be restarted again
19.03.19 07:59:52<editable-dog>wasnt it better when they were there with the other stylesheets?
19.03.19 08:00:25<editable-dog>alternatively, it would be even better if they were a part of the vue component i suppose
19.03.19 08:00:33<editable-dog>whats your goal with this?
19.03.19 08:01:16<stoopkid> it was except for that it made their stylings appear before the bootstrap styling, so bootstrap was overriding the things i was already trying to override in bootstrap
19.03.19 08:01:30<editable-dog>aha
19.03.19 08:02:18<stoopkid> so the navbar works now more or less, now we just gotta fill in the content and link it all together
19.03.19 08:02:46<editable-dog>yeah nice!
19.03.19 08:04:05<stoopkid> hrm it's only working on the main page
19.03.19 08:04:18<stoopkid> the other pages aren't getting the stylings for some reason
19.03.19 08:04:26<editable-dog>so, im pondering an alternative-ish organization of the site.. something like We You Done Todo
19.03.19 08:05:20<editable-dog>We You Done Todo Undercategorized
19.03.19 08:05:47<editable-dog>We You Todo Done Undercategorized
19.03.19 08:07:12<stoopkid> alright fixed it for the other pages
19.03.19 08:07:18<editable-dog>nice
19.03.19 08:07:36<editable-dog>i wonder if i can make gridsome restart everytime it should
19.03.19 08:08:21<stoopkid> so i.e. any time you write to gridsome.config.js or gridsome.server.js ?
19.03.19 08:09:43<stoopkid> can you elaborate on the alternative-ish organization
19.03.19 08:10:26<editable-dog>i think it also doesnt watch src/ files, at the very least
19.03.19 08:11:00<stoopkid> it should be live-updating everything in src/ i think
19.03.19 08:12:05<editable-dog>well i was thinking about how we need to merge "past projects" and "references", but i guess we already have "portfolio", so..dunno
19.03.19 08:12:51<editable-dog>but then, we probably mostly want to fill the blog with past projects
19.03.19 08:13:27<editable-dog>like, in your customer-speak, what is "Blog" to a customer
19.03.19 08:15:15<editable-dog>maybe if i decide to go on a rant about something, then it could fit under "Blog", but again "Rants" may be a better site section
19.03.19 08:16:35<editable-dog>i do think we want to put up fairly technical content as well as the business stuff
19.03.19 08:17:10<editable-dog>so we can interact with other devs etc this way
19.03.19 08:17:40<editable-dog>for example i wrote up the kbdbg2sparql or something post
19.03.19 08:18:41<stoopkid> sure
19.03.19 08:19:14<editable-dog>im gonna have at least one similarly technical post from pavel, about how you can replace an encrypted sd card in some phone...very geeky stuff, but actually original research/content, that could theoretically drive in visitors
19.03.19 08:20:32<editable-dog>so im thinking that links to these articles should be on the same page with links to past projects
19.03.19 08:20:44<editable-dog>idk
19.03.19 08:21:21<editable-dog>well i guess lets give it a try, we can always change it back easily
19.03.19 08:26:20<editable-dog>i guess it means we want to have no blog index page, and we're gonna link to individual blog posts from other pages
19.03.19 08:26:27<editable-dog>i can play with it later
19.03.19 08:56:35<stoopkid> i think it would maybe make sense to leave Portfolio and Blog separate and have the business-y stuff in the portfolio and the personal-ish/technical-ish stuff in the blog
19.03.19 08:58:19<stoopkid> we can have blog-posts about past projects but we should still have the one dressed up portfolio/resume/cv/past-projects/references page
19.03.19 09:00:29<editable-dog>i guess if we collect enough dressed-up content for it, then yeah
19.03.19 09:02:00<editable-dog>but if we find we dont have all that much to write about, then going a little unconventional might help
19.03.19 09:02:02<editable-dog>will see
19.03.19 09:02:53<stoopkid> well at the moment we might take out Portfolio entirely and just focus on having a well put-together Services section/page that we can maybe start show-casing some things without it having to have been a paid project for somebody else all dressed up and portfolio-worthy
19.03.19 09:04:40<stoopkid> so main/banner page, About, Services, Blog, and Contact? with the Contact probably just being the footer of every page, and the banner page, About & Services possibly all being smashed into one long page
19.03.19 09:05:28<editable-dog>sure, lets go with it
19.03.19 09:05:51<stoopkid> you'd think Contact would generally just go in the About section but for some reason most sites seem to separate them
19.03.19 09:06:02<stoopkid> i guess maybe most sites have a longer mission statement than we do lol..
19.03.19 09:09:38<stoopkid> hrm..
19.03.19 09:11:10<stoopkid> one issue w/ having the Contact be the footer is you would think to just have the contact button link to "#contact" and it will just jump to the footer, which works great except for if you've already pressed contact then the browser is pointed to "mysite.com/page#contact" and it won't go to the link again
19.03.19 09:11:17<stoopkid> at least in firefox, lemme check chrome
19.03.19 09:12:36<stoopkid> not sure if there a configuration of the <a> tag or something that would force it to jump to the section every time even if the browser thinks you're already at the section
19.03.19 09:13:28<stoopkid> js could probably make the problem go away but hopefully that would be overkill for this issue?
19.03.19 09:18:31<stoopkid> ok so.. are we actually going with the name software for immortality or should we come up w/ something else?
19.03.19 09:19:39<editable-dog>iiiidk
19.03.19 09:19:55<stoopkid> idk it's just maybe... extremely specific?
19.03.19 09:20:19<stoopkid> and also maybe extremely extreme?
19.03.19 09:20:43<editable-dog>yea lol
19.03.19 09:21:40<editable-dog>i still think its a good idea wrt potential external funding, but we may want to situate it as just a project of ours 
19.03.19 09:22:41<stoopkid> i would think so especially since i would think that currently it's kind of false advertising lol
19.03.19 09:24:20<editable-dog>wouldnt say its false, or advertising, we're just working on extremely limited budget
19.03.19 09:24:26<stoopkid> lol
19.03.19 09:24:49<stoopkid> i guess that's technically fair
19.03.19 09:24:56<editable-dog>but at the moment somebody rich enough realizes that sw development could prolong his life, ive got them covered
19.03.19 09:25:15<stoopkid> that's good to know
19.03.19 09:25:31<stoopkid> https://www.namemesh.com/domain-name-search/immortal?show=1
19.03.19 09:25:47<stoopkid> i kind of like the immortal monkey for w/e reason
19.03.19 09:25:52<stoopkid> not sure if that fits either heh
19.03.19 09:26:33<editable-dog>yea i think thats a nice name
19.03.19 09:27:40<stoopkid> certainly would make it easy to figure out what the logo would be heh
19.03.19 09:29:52<stoopkid> maybe infinite monkey or something: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem
19.03.19 09:33:03<editable-dog>btw, only kind of offtopic, since we tend to discuss potential long term business plans/ideas, something i havent mentioned before, me and pavel are fairly curious about digital data keeping/organization, and sometimes i think i'd like to build a service for non-technical people to keep and organize their data in the cloud kind of..i dont have a clear idea...but..anyway.
19.03.19 09:34:02<stoopkid> i'd be interested in that
19.03.19 09:34:19<editable-dog>idk, infinite monkey would maybe be a bit too obvious hint at our incapacity
19.03.19 09:36:49<stoopkid> hehe.. so.. idk i could probably work w/ immortal monkey what do you think? maybe should ask pavel too
19.03.19 09:37:24<stoopkid> megan immediately said no lol
19.03.19 09:39:57<editable-dog>i dont think pavel would care
19.03.19 09:40:04<editable-dog>its also a kind of pu-erh..i like that
19.03.19 09:41:21<stoopkid> pu-erh?
19.03.19 09:41:36<editable-dog>its a kind of tea
19.03.19 09:42:21<editable-dog>idk..does megan have a better idea?
19.03.19 09:44:09<editable-dog>https://cz.pinterest.com/pin/84512930483263965/
19.03.19 09:44:23<stoopkid> idk cause my phone died but i guess let's roll w/ it for now if you want
19.03.19 09:44:46<editable-dog>lol
19.03.19 09:44:51<editable-dog>ok
19.03.19 09:44:59<editable-dog>yeah
19.03.19 09:46:30<editable-dog>i got a bit distracted by the restart script idea, but it wasnt getting anywhere near done..so..screw it
19.03.19 09:48:13<editable-dog>let me see the contacts link issue
19.03.19 10:03:19<editable-dog>https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=G29GCLV2VWCA
19.03.19 10:03:29<editable-dog>it works here
19.03.19 10:05:33<editable-dog> Unknown argument "width" on field "coverImage"
19.03.19 10:09:57<editable-dog>the anchor name stays in the url bar but it still does the jump
19.03.19 10:12:10<editable-dog>ah, i think your css messes with the menu item...like ..you cant click any menu item twice
19.03.19 10:14:57<stoopkid> weird
19.03.19 10:15:14<editable-dog>the css class changes or something?
19.03.19 10:24:16<stoopkid> idk possibly something deeper in bootstrap
19.03.19 10:26:35<stoopkid> well, anyway, i guess we basically have a site now
19.03.19 10:27:22<editable-dog>ok
19.03.19 10:27:36<editable-dog>i keep being distracted here, sorry
19.03.19 10:27:49<editable-dog>will have to go over everything
19.03.19 10:28:35<editable-dog>i guess we lost the light/dark styling
19.03.19 10:28:43<editable-dog>i see an unstyled checkbox at the top
19.03.19 10:30:49<stoopkid> that's the toggle for the menu so i guess some styles aren't rendering properly
19.03.19 10:30:52<stoopkid> i'm not seeing it though
19.03.19 10:33:23<stoopkid> you're getting a full-width black navbar where the links show different colors with a bright underline?
19.03.19 10:34:45<stoopkid> if so then i'm not sure why you'd get the unstyled checkbox, but also try hovering your mouse over the underline and see if it flashes rapidly
19.03.19 10:35:30<stoopkid> firefox doesn't, chrome does
19.03.19 10:35:33<stoopkid> for me at least
19.03.19 10:37:03<stoopkid> we should probably make a bugs & to-do list
19.03.19 10:37:32<editable-dog>meh, it was just gridsome develop needing a restart again
19.03.19 10:37:39<editable-dog>maybe i should take time to finish that script 
19.03.19 10:37:58<editable-dog>anyway, i see one issue, center your mouse between two navigation links
19.03.19 10:40:23<stoopkid> in chrome it flashes rapidly back & forth, in firefox it's a little more sane
19.03.19 10:41:13<editable-dog>i guess the text should just not move at all, underline is flashy enough
19.03.19 10:41:55<editable-dog>the rapid flashing is the bounce
19.03.19 10:43:20<editable-dog>also, idk if we want to have like a separate logo and About in the navbar, if they both point to the same thing
19.03.19 10:44:40<stoopkid> maybe not, we should probably expand the content a bit so that it actually makes sense to have it tho
19.03.19 10:55:43<stoopkid> alright that's fixed
19.03.19 10:55:55<stoopkid> (the flashing)
19.03.19 10:57:07<editable-dog>nice
19.03.19 10:57:25<editable-dog>i cant figure out what the link issue is
19.03.19 10:57:38<stoopkid> yea im still stumped on that one
19.03.19 11:01:53<editable-dog>well when you click a link, a file like http://localhost:8080/assets/js/component--home.js is loaded
19.03.19 11:02:15<stoopkid> hrm..
19.03.19 11:02:53<stoopkid> is that just on the develop server or on the dist ?
19.03.19 11:03:29<editable-dog>im sure ive seen this functionality somewhere, turning the active page's nav button into a non-link...
19.03.19 11:03:37<editable-dog>dunno
19.03.19 11:04:40<editable-dog>yea not on the dist
19.03.19 11:07:32<stoopkid> the horizontal overflow issue is probably just a matter of me using bad html with the string of <code> sections
19.03.19 11:09:30<stoopkid> so i guess i'll just leave that until we're actually trying to refine the services section
19.03.19 11:23:38<editable-dog>so, the nav link clicks are handled through vue router..
19.03.19 11:25:47<stoopkid> i see..
19.03.19 11:35:02<stoopkid> did you fix it? cause it seems fixed now
19.03.19 11:35:47<stoopkid> at least on firefox
19.03.19 11:41:06<stoopkid> ah nvm it's because i disabled javascript
19.03.19 11:44:53<stoopkid> so i guess what i'd wonder is if you can override or configure the vue router to handle it properly
19.03.19 11:46:11<stoopkid> actually i think the vue routing is only happening during develop?
19.03.19 11:50:17<stoopkid> well, i guess something js is definitely screwing w/ it even in dist
19.03.19 11:51:00<stoopkid> so i wonder how it's producing this js
19.03.19 11:51:08<editable-dog>i think we should submit to it instead, with something like <router-link to="home">Home</router-link>
19.03.19 11:51:57<editable-dog>but i think i wanna read the gridsome source to try to really understand how this whole thing works
19.03.19 11:52:29<stoopkid> i started reading it some but only got a little way into it
19.03.19 11:54:39<stoopkid> have you learned webpack
19.03.19 11:55:31<editable-dog>so, this doesnt change anything
19.03.19 11:55:33<editable-dog>nope
19.03.19 12:11:06<editable-dog>nope, i dont see any difference
19.03.19 12:11:53<stoopkid> are you looking at develop or dist
19.03.19 12:11:59<editable-dog>develop
19.03.19 12:12:28<stoopkid> in dist it works; everything in develop is handled dynamically
19.03.19 12:13:10<stoopkid> although i guess maybe that dynamics should account for this change? idk
19.03.19 12:14:44<editable-dog>what was the g-route or something tag you tried?
19.03.19 12:14:57<stoopkid> g-link, didn't work though
19.03.19 12:16:08<editable-dog>hmm
19.03.19 12:16:34<stoopkid> apparently blog images aren't rendered w/ the scripts removed
19.03.19 12:16:53<stoopkid> i'm generally a fan of obliterating the scripts and then adding them back in in a controlled fashion
19.03.19 12:17:04<editable-dog>what scripts did you remove?
19.03.19 12:17:35<stoopkid> just the ${scripts} section in index.html
19.03.19 12:18:26<stoopkid> apparently that's where it puts the scripts that trigger whatever chain events screws up the nav-links
19.03.19 12:18:32<stoopkid> chain of*
19.03.19 12:19:07<stoopkid> well, hypothetically it could've been the light/dark thing but i'm doubting it
19.03.19 12:19:24<editable-dog>yea doubtful
19.03.19 12:19:59<editable-dog>so yeah, when you disable all vue js, then the link just takes you to the appropriate static page/anchor
19.03.19 12:20:36<editable-dog>so you lose the SPA functionality, where it should just fetch whatever content and assets it needs and replace the relevant part of the dom
19.03.19 12:20:56<editable-dog>i think
19.03.19 12:21:08<stoopkid> so the only other place it's sticking scripts unless we put them in manually is in the head, we could obliterate the head and put in a custom head but that would probably be tough since it's sticking autogenerated styling stuff in there; not sure if we can remove the scripts independently of that
19.03.19 12:21:25<stoopkid> i think that's right
19.03.19 12:24:36<stoopkid> for a site of this size though i would call the SPA functionality an enhancement, not something critical to the operation of the page like a dynamically rendered form or something
19.03.19 12:27:58<editable-dog>yeah we could call it a day and come back to it when we want to get more profficient with the frameworks
19.03.19 12:30:06<stoopkid> well, one last tweak so that we can at least say the site is functioning properly, i want to get that image removed off your blog post heh
19.03.19 12:30:34<stoopkid> a couple tweaks to the header but i can work on that
19.03.19 12:31:03<stoopkid> and then i want to actually put in some contact info & put this up wherever we're gonna host it
19.03.19 12:31:49<editable-dog>github pages i guess
19.03.19 12:31:59<editable-dog>ok im gonna go read on vue router
19.03.19 12:33:06<stoopkid> i guess we could potentially put it up multiple places, pages, netlify, etc.. as part of show-casing that we have lots of options for deployment
19.03.19 12:33:17<editable-dog>yeah
19.03.19 12:33:59<editable-dog>well, we should put some demo site in multiple places, not the real site
19.03.19 12:34:26<stoopkid> true
19.03.19 12:35:27<stoopkid> i really can't tell why this one needs an image and the other one doesn't
19.03.19 12:35:35<stoopkid> hrm
19.03.19 12:37:41<stoopkid> i think it's maybe that the graphql query is somehow expecting there to be non-zero number of cover images
19.03.19 12:38:05<stoopkid> cause i just put the cover image on the other blog post and now yours works just fine without it
19.03.19 12:39:49<stoopkid> i wonder if the markdown transformer doesn't generate a cover_image attribute in its graphql representation if you don't have any cover_images included
19.03.19 12:40:34<stoopkid> what's the command to ssh tunnel to the develop server?
19.03.19 12:41:37<editable-dog>ssh -v -L 8080:localhost:8080 sfi@51.140.155.227
19.03.19 12:41:45<editable-dog>and once for 9000
19.03.19 12:45:12<editable-dog>what do you mean, hat image do you want to remove?
19.03.19 12:45:33<stoopkid> on the blog post
19.03.19 12:45:40<editable-dog>on the gridsome one?
19.03.19 12:46:31<stoopkid> currently gridsome seems to be expecting there to be a cover_image on at least one of the blog posts so having just your one blog post without a cover image breaks it
19.03.19 12:54:24<editable-dog>coverImages obliterated.
19.03.19 12:54:39<stoopkid> ok cool
19.03.19 13:38:58<stoopkid> hrm, having trouble getting the footer to stick to the bottom for short pages (ex. blog right now)
19.03.19 13:41:06<stoopkid> i guess i need to get better w/ css
19.03.19 13:41:44<editable-dog>haha yeah i guess i'll leave this one entirely on you
19.03.19 14:41:09<stoopkid> ok i got better enough to make the footer stick to the bottom at least
19.03.19 14:45:13<stoopkid> should we make something like immortalmonkey@gmail.com
19.03.19 14:52:43<editable-dog>well, theres an element of cutting edge minimalism in that, but i think most people wouldnt appreciate it
19.03.19 14:54:31<editable-dog>we can handle email for our own domain on pavel's server, but theres a couple of downsides to that
19.03.19 14:54:47<stoopkid> hrm, well, the footer sticks to the bottom but it obscures page content if the content actually goes down to the bottom.. this method seems to only work if you know the footer height a priori, which doesn't really seem possible w/ responsive design
19.03.19 14:55:12<editable-dog>the nicest solution would be using our own domain but with google apps, or how its called. But then it wont be free
19.03.19 15:00:05<stoopkid> i guess a question will be whether we're invested enough in the name to buy a domain for it
19.03.19 15:02:08<editable-dog>ill try to talk to him tomorrow, maybe we'll come up with some mutually beneficial solution
19.03.19 15:02:45<editable-dog>idk, has megan came home yet?:)
19.03.19 15:03:13<stoopkid> not til 5 or so
19.03.19 15:07:08<editable-dog>hmm there might be a way to get the best of both worlds for free, kinda
19.03.19 15:08:37<editable-dog>buut registering that gmail account would be a good start towards that, so go ahead if you feel like it
19.03.19 15:12:51<editable-dog>ok we could probably set the thing up through https://www.mailgun.com/ , at least we'd be prepared when some client wants us to spam his clients
19.03.19 15:13:29<editable-dog>if we do websites, it kinda goes along with it
19.03.19 15:14:54<editable-dog>well, lets ponder on the domain for a few days i guess
19.03.19 15:22:29<editable-dog>hmm, i got up at 7, and was hacking on proof traces ..
19.03.19 15:22:42<editable-dog>you showed up at 10 my time..
19.03.19 15:23:42<editable-dog>i started losing breath around 17, at best
19.03.19 15:25:13<editable-dog>been kinda trying to find something about vue routing to latch onto then
19.03.19 15:25:30<editable-dog>then spent some very minimal time pretending family life
19.03.19 15:25:38<editable-dog>and now it feels like the day is over
19.03.19 15:29:04<stoopkid> well i guess let's figure out what we wanna work on tomorrow
19.03.19 15:32:14<editable-dog>idk, i could just go on reading one of the zillion resources i had to google today, and poking at vue or webpack..
19.03.19 15:32:28<editable-dog>well, understanding webpack might be a worthwhile task
19.03.19 15:33:57<editable-dog>idk, got something in mind?
19.03.19 15:35:05<editable-dog>or graphql
19.03.19 15:35:14<stoopkid> webpack would be good but idk whether it makes to jump into that immediately
19.03.19 15:35:24<stoopkid> i feel like at our scale we've maybe got more front-end issues than back-end
19.03.19 15:36:29<editable-dog>well thats the thing, when trying to figure out the how's and why's of the routing thing, im now reading some webpacked js..
19.03.19 15:37:05<stoopkid> ah
19.03.19 15:37:08<editable-dog>so understanding where it came from and how might be helpful
19.03.19 15:37:41<stoopkid> well we stripped the js out for now anyway though
19.03.19 15:37:54<stoopkid> i guess i'm just weighing how involved i predict all that routing is relative to tomorrow
19.03.19 15:39:14<editable-dog>well i think of it more like a good bait to go deeper in learning whatever, because i feel i need to learn much more before i can offer a website to anyone
19.03.19 15:40:00<editable-dog>its kinda lame to strip out the js from vue just couse it breaks our footer link lol
19.03.19 15:40:24<stoopkid> i would've tried to strip the js out anyway that just prompted me to try to do it sooner heh
19.03.19 15:40:36<editable-dog>hehe gotcha
19.03.19 15:41:09<editable-dog>yeah im fine with rolling with the no-js site for a while
19.03.19 15:41:30<editable-dog>i will set up pushing to github pages if you want
19.03.19 15:41:35<editable-dog>now
19.03.19 15:42:08<stoopkid> sure
19.03.19 15:42:19<editable-dog>and you wanna spend some time on the content i guess..that works for me too
19.03.19 15:44:25<stoopkid> i guess i want to bring the js back in a controlled fashion and it looks to do that would definitely require getting deeper into the gridsome/vue/webpack internals, so i feel like we should maybe upgrade to js in the same process as getting deeper into those internals; we can still offer js stuff through external APIs etc.. we're only really stripping *gridsome's* js
19.03.19 15:49:51<stoopkid> i definitely don't think we should re-enable the gridsome js until we have full-control over the vue-router and how all the rest of that js is working anyway
19.03.19 15:52:17<stoopkid> we definitely wanna be getting down into the internals at some point and enabling the js, ideally soon, i just don't know about tomorrow soon cause it seems lower priority than the non-js front-end stuff
19.03.19 15:53:59<editable-dog>i wonder how it estimates the reading time
19.03.19 15:54:14<editable-dog>1 minute for my blog post?
19.03.19 15:54:25<editable-dog>i was writing it a hour
19.03.19 15:54:52<stoopkid> well that sounds about the right ratio
19.03.19 15:55:08<stoopkid> they're still faster readers than me though heh
19.03.19 15:55:50<editable-dog>ok so what non-js frontend stuff do you wanna deal with first?
19.03.19 15:57:13<stoopkid> well, on second thought i'm wondering whether there even is anything at this point that doesn't just fall under my design side of things
19.03.19 15:57:43<stoopkid> i guess we're at the stage where we should be figuring out what feature we would actually want to implement next and maybe that will help us prioritize
19.03.19 15:58:39<stoopkid> cause i guess i mostly just have design clean-up left to do on what we have now, maybe toying around with some of the styles they used on the starter blog posts, they seemed decent
19.03.19 15:59:24<stoopkid> so i can probably do that on the side and not waste our overlap time w/ random shit
19.03.19 16:00:43<stoopkid> i guess my issue w/ getting into the internals tomorrow is we're not quite at the stage where delving into the internals is gonna get us any particular feature except for maybe fixing that random navbar thing that's already fixed, unless you can think of something else in particular
19.03.19 16:01:39<stoopkid> if we wanted to try to integrate some more content types besides markdown, then that would maybe be something but i can't think of anything in particular at the moment
19.03.19 16:08:17<stoopkid> documentation of what we've already done that could form the basis of some content might be good
19.03.19 16:09:36<stoopkid> not sure if it warrants us planning a day around it but otoh maybe that would motivate us to actually do it
19.03.19 16:15:38<stoopkid> i figure if we get to the point where we have enough content on there to warrant a separate "about us" page, that might be a good time to actually try out google maps or something if we haven't already by that point
19.03.19 16:17:20<stoopkid> i guess maybe we should focus in on the services section and see if we can get some ideas by elaborating on the services we've written out there, i guess that was our initial strategy with this site design anyway
19.03.19 16:24:25<stoopkid> not quite sure how to integrate this with the "portfolio" stuff but for lack of portfolio-worthy work done for other people one way we could get relevant content, site design, and features is to think about designing the site to essentially be a tutorial in each of our services
19.03.19 16:25:48<stoopkid> to start with, stuff like "this is what you should be looking for in modern site design", "this is why our shit's the best"
19.03.19 16:28:58<stoopkid> e-commerce would be a thing to look at but again not sure about tomorrow
19.03.19 16:29:15<stoopkid> ex. can we set up some mechanism for somebody to pay us externally to upwork/freelancer
19.03.19 16:29:40<stoopkid> i.e. some "pay us" button on our site that actually works
19.03.19 16:30:01<stoopkid> there's always a bitcoin address..
19.03.19 16:33:09<stoopkid> and ofc we could dig into your past projects and see what we can potentially pull in as content
19.03.19 16:34:28<stoopkid> actually i guess one thing that would make sense to look into more immediately would be CMS
19.03.19 16:36:32<stoopkid> i wonder how hard it would be to integrate a locally-hosted CMS thing into gridsome
19.03.19 16:38:48<stoopkid> i mean, you're already running a nodejs server so if you had some kind of form input could you talk to nodejs through the develop server and have it dynamically update content?
19.03.19 16:48:35<stoopkid> it would probably make sense if every vue component was bundled with the form that would edit it
19.03.19 17:01:59<stoopkid> wrt the navbar i'm thinking i might just leave the background the solid color and just do the underline on hover, that'll leave the page w/ a bit more color when the user isn't pressing the buttons
19.03.19 17:22:41<stoopkid> what do you think about putting up our freelancer pictures
19.03.19 17:22:46<stoopkid> in the about us section
19.03.19 18:10:12<stoopkid> alright got all of my little front-end bugs sorted out except for the footer
19.03.19 18:28:08<stoopkid> i'd say the site actually seems to work fine at all zoom levels?
19.03.19 18:46:28<stoopkid> found more bugs but now just back to the footer again heh
19.03.19 18:54:39<editable-dog>pictures..ill think about it
19.03.19 18:55:26<editable-dog>i just had a quick chat with the XPlane guy on freelancer, and then read some code and watched some videos about it
19.03.19 18:55:59<editable-dog>he should get back to me
19.03.19 18:56:14<stoopkid> nice
19.03.19 18:56:26<editable-dog>i told him we should integrate the speech recognition functionality into the existing Xchecklist plugin
19.03.19 18:56:33<editable-dog>he said he'd try to contact the author
19.03.19 18:59:54<editable-dog>wrt tomorrow...the more i think about it, the more i think i just want to coast for a while
19.03.19 19:00:04<editable-dog>i have a shitton of tabs open from today
19.03.19 19:00:10<editable-dog>i want to get back to some of that
19.03.19 19:00:30<editable-dog>not to mention the infinite shittons from before that
19.03.19 19:01:01<editable-dog>oh i pushed it http://software-for-immortality.github.io
19.03.19 19:02:24<editable-dog>but...i guess i like the idea of working on the content a bit
19.03.19 19:02:55<editable-dog>to see what we can write up about what we did so far wrt the site
19.03.19 19:03:18<editable-dog>"we broke same-page links, so we disabled javascript"
19.03.19 19:04:45<editable-dog>"even with client-side js disabled, there are still 7 layers of js frameworks under this that we dont understand"
19.03.19 19:06:49<stoopkid> well, i guess we could just dive in tomorrow and try to see if we can get full control of those layers in order to get full control over generated client-side js
19.03.19 19:08:21<editable-dog>yeah i guess we can keep poking into it
19.03.19 19:09:27<stoopkid> i guess i can come up with 3 tangible goals for that: 1) fix the js routing so we can have it available if we want, 2) make it also work with js obliterated, 3) make it output prettified js/css assets and have minimization/obfuscation be another phase that we can run independently
19.03.19 19:10:47<stoopkid> (4) on my end, see if i can just drop bootstrap cause i'm not sure if i'm necessarily using it for anything yet
19.03.19 19:11:28<stoopkid> i'll want to integrate something like that back in ofc but right now it seems like all i'm doing is overriding bootstrap not actually using it
19.03.19 19:20:35<editable-dog>hehe
19.03.19 19:20:52<editable-dog>there's also bootstrap-vue, but i have no idea what its about
19.03.19 19:21:13<stoopkid> yea idk
19.03.19 19:21:48<editable-dog>wrt goals, idk, im just in a curious mode wrt to the routing stuff, want to feel like i understand my tools
19.03.19 19:22:05<stoopkid> at this point i feel like it's overkill and just a poor substitute for actually learning CSS, since all it is some CSS presets
19.03.19 19:23:27<stoopkid> i guess (5) would be see if we can fix that little content_image bug w/o obliterating content_images entirely
19.03.19 19:24:49<stoopkid> and.. this is perhaps a good opportunity to see about using it as a CMS
19.03.19 19:25:40<editable-dog>we probably just need to study graphql for that
19.03.19 19:26:01<stoopkid> so (6) would be assess whether it's capable of being used as a CMS and maybe start planning how we might want to do it if we can see that it would work
19.03.19 19:26:24<editable-dog>using what as a cms?
19.03.19 19:26:45<stoopkid> gridsome develop basically
19.03.19 19:27:57<editable-dog>i think the idea is that you set up your content sources in the config files
19.03.19 19:28:13<editable-dog>and this way wire it up to an actual cms if you want
19.03.19 19:31:40<stoopkid> so i guess 6 would be to look into that, but the ideal i would think would be to have the develop mode & the cms mode be the same thing
19.03.19 19:34:43<stoopkid> all it would need is the ability to respond to forms in develop mode and it could serve as a locally-hosted CMS for static-site generation.. well i guess that plus making it output just the resulting site instead of the one that includes all the CMS forms..
19.03.19 19:35:16<editable-dog>idk, i cant really follow your train of thought here, but i keep thinking if building a site page by page by hand like this is really the way to go, i guess if in the end its just static content anyway. 
19.03.19 19:36:43<editable-dog>so you have some kind of wysiwyg vue components composer/editor in mind
19.03.19 19:37:10<editable-dog>sounds fairly crazy
19.03.19 19:39:59<stoopkid> i guess integrating with one/more of the more standard CMSs is probabowly more in scope right n
19.03.19 19:40:04<stoopkid> probably* now*
19.03.19 19:41:31<stoopkid> ideally over time there will be less and less that we have to actually craft by hand that isn't just setting some well-defined configuration settings instead of hacking around html/css
19.03.19 19:41:47<editable-dog>we can definitely bounce the idea around a bit
19.03.19 19:42:01<editable-dog>right
19.03.19 19:42:21<editable-dog>so maybe looking into available cms's is what we should do next
19.03.19 19:43:30<stoopkid> i'd agree and i think we should probably really focus on figuring out who the target audience would actually be
19.03.19 19:44:09<stoopkid> well, maybe
19.03.19 19:44:22<stoopkid> i guess we're not really solely marketing ourselves around gridsome development so..
19.03.19 19:47:04<stoopkid> we can probably safely assume that this gridsome stuff isn't gonna represent the majority of jobs we can expect to be landing when we're just scraping around for whatever we can get.., so we should probably file it away as mainly just being our thing for developing our own portfolio site & show-casing some of the fancier cutting-edge stuff we can do (i.e. SSG, SPA, graphql data integration, ..)
19.03.19 19:48:14<editable-dog>no i think the "make me a website" jobs are quite frequent on freelancer
19.03.19 19:48:24<editable-dog>i suppose the competition will be tough tho
19.03.19 19:48:52<stoopkid> and it's not specifically "make me a gridsome website" yet and often it might be specifically not a gridsome site
19.03.19 19:49:00<editable-dog>idk, ill start paying more attention to it
19.03.19 19:49:36<stoopkid> i dont see anything in freelancer
                 <editable-dog>i think it may often be from people who dont care about the frameworks
19.03.19 19:50:24<stoopkid> hrm true
19.03.19 19:50:57<editable-dog>I'm looking at building a website , a social directory website.
                 <stoopkid> plenty of stuff for vue though so i guess it kinda goes hand-in-hand
19.03.19 19:51:09<editable-dog>Skills required
                 <editable-dog>Django, MongoDB, node.js, Python, React.js
19.03.19 19:51:35<editable-dog>iow, "some stuff i've read websites are built in"
19.03.19 19:51:51<stoopkid> lol
19.03.19 19:52:45<stoopkid> ok fair we could at least try to actually push the option and see if they go for it
19.03.19 19:52:54<stoopkid> and at least give the framework a chance
19.03.19 19:53:26<editable-dog>Design and host a website
19.03.19 19:53:31<editable-dog>$30 - $250
19.03.19 19:53:42<editable-dog>I want to have a website designed (4-5 pages) and hosted
19.03.19 19:53:59<editable-dog>Skills required
19.03.19 19:54:00<editable-dog>Graphic Design, HTML, PHP, User Interface / IA, Website Design
19.03.19 19:54:19<stoopkid> might be a good exercise in documentation / content-writing tho if we worked out a standard pitch for why we think gridsome+vue is a good option for them beyond "cause it's the one we know right now"
19.03.19 19:54:24<editable-dog>FREELANCERS BIDDING (79) 
19.03.19 19:54:42<editable-dog>lol, thats the most ive seen on any gig
19.03.19 19:55:19<editable-dog>yeah sounds good
19.03.19 19:55:38<editable-dog>we can probably paraphrase somebody advocating for vue out there
19.03.19 19:55:45<editable-dog>everyone loves vue, at least
19.03.19 19:55:52<stoopkid> yea that's so many lol, i'm glad we have a basic site up now at least so we can at least start differentiating ourselves
19.03.19 19:56:51<stoopkid> although our site isn't really much beyond barely existing (but i guess at least it exists responsively?)
19.03.19 20:02:03<editable-dog>its always nice being able to build websites for friends, if nothing else lol
19.03.19 20:25:11<editable-dog>    // do not convert telephone numbers
                 <editable-dog>    // into hypertext links because it
                 <editable-dog>    // will cause hydration errors
19.03.19 20:27:41<editable-dog>hmm, dont expect me up too early tomorrow
19.03.19 20:28:54<stoopkid> heh alright
19.03.19 20:40:41<stoopkid> ah nope can't take out bootstrap yet cause that's what's providing all the toggle stylings.. i'd have to figure out how to replicate that
19.03.19 21:20:06<stoopkid> alright finally really got the footer thing solved lol
19.03.19 21:20:40<editable-dog>yeah?
19.03.19 21:22:06<stoopkid> yea only major thing that's left on the simple front-end stuff is to fix the x-overflow on the main page
19.03.19 21:25:17<stoopkid> do you get chrome misaligning the links w/ the navbar when zooming out to 50% and 33% ?
19.03.19 21:25:57<stoopkid> specifically after 67% -> 50% and 50% -> 33%, it seems to stay aligned when zooming back in
19.03.19 21:26:05<editable-dog>yeah
19.03.19 21:26:21<editable-dog>yeah
19.03.19 21:28:16<editable-dog>thats the Immortal Monkey getting breaked into two lines
19.03.19 21:29:53<editable-dog>i have a new plan for our overlap time tomorrow: sleeping
19.03.19 21:45:10<stoopkid> hehe
19.03.19 21:48:14<editable-dog>im making some progress with the routing thing
19.03.19 21:49:05<stoopkid> nice
19.03.19 21:49:26<stoopkid> fixed the misalignment thing & the x-overflow thing
19.03.19 21:49:56<stoopkid> so that's pretty much everything on the front-end
19.03.19 21:50:16<stoopkid> except maybe for some really extreme zoom / screen-size configurations
19.03.19 21:53:07<stoopkid> maybe tomorrow you can walk me through the routing thing
19.03.19 21:53:31<stoopkid> unless tonight would be better for you? haha
19.03.19 21:53:44<editable-dog>i first need to walk to the end of it myself
19.03.19 21:54:21<editable-dog>so far i could only point you to some features along the road, but i dont quite know what they mean
19.03.19 21:57:38<editable-dog>soo, yeah there are some cosmetic issues at extreme ends of the zoom
19.03.19 21:57:54<editable-dog>but i'd say really just cosmetic
19.03.19 21:58:46<stoopkid> if we have some kind of concrete theory for how to account for those edge-cases i'm down to implement it but i don't have such a theory at the moment
19.03.19 21:59:06<editable-dog>you cant cheat it by making the Services section seem longer, but good try
19.03.19 21:59:24<editable-dog>j/k
19.03.19 21:59:32<stoopkid> haha
19.03.19 22:00:00<editable-dog>well i have two theories, first is that you should make the footer stick to the bottom of the page at all times
19.03.19 22:01:46<editable-dog>im actually afraid that this doesnt take an extreme zoomout to appear, might as well happen on some retina displays or something maybe
19.03.19 22:03:58<editable-dog>and the second theory is that the white area around the header should always go all the way around its contents
19.03.19 22:04:03<editable-dog>idk lol
19.03.19 22:07:11<editable-dog>ssh  -L 8080:localhost:8080    -L 9000:localhost:9000     sfi@51.140.155.227
19.03.19 22:07:13<editable-dog>nice
19.03.19 22:07:19<editable-dog>one line
19.03.19 22:07:21<stoopkid> nice
19.03.19 22:09:19<stoopkid> so one issue is if you have small display & zoom in real far the email is too long to fit on the screen & it doesn't word-wrap
19.03.19 22:09:27<stoopkid> normally i would think to just word-wrap but it's an e-mail
19.03.19 22:10:38<editable-dog>well, you can scroll horizontally to see it all, if only it wasnt black text against black background
19.03.19 22:11:07<editable-dog>so why dont those header and footer backgrounds go all the way around their contents?
19.03.19 22:11:31<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
19.03.19 22:11:52<editable-dog>oh sorry i have inverted colors
19.03.19 22:12:00<stoopkid> heh
19.03.19 22:12:04<editable-dog>white text against white background
19.03.19 22:13:07<stoopkid> ok i see what you mean
19.03.19 22:15:13<editable-dog>nope
19.03.19 22:48:14<stoopkid> well i just had it wrap the email as a fall-back but header is still going out of its bounds
19.03.19 22:53:16<editable-dog>the header that you set to nowrap earlier to avoid the button misalignment?:)
19.03.19 22:53:35<stoopkid> yep :)
19.03.19 22:57:40<stoopkid> what we should really be doing at that scale is dropping the text logo and putting a small image logo
19.03.19 23:00:43<editable-dog>not sure, would have to ask somebody half-blind what they think
19.03.19 23:01:54<editable-dog>im fairly sure there are people who zoom in really hard so they can read 
19.03.19 23:02:29<editable-dog>but thats all i think i know about it really
19.03.19 23:03:30<editable-dog>but its a "market" thats appealing to me
19.03.19 23:03:56<editable-dog>heh
19.03.19 23:05:02<editable-dog>come on its 2019, nested block comments still arent a thing?
19.03.19 23:06:11<stoopkid> a comment tag probably would've made sense
19.03.19 23:06:53<editable-dog>err i was commenting on some js here
19.03.19 23:07:04<stoopkid> ah
19.03.19 23:07:13<editable-dog>sorry
19.03.19 23:18:37<stoopkid> so i guess for drawing boundaries on this zoom thing we should be thinking about what's the minimum number of characters that should be able to fit on the page on any display/zoom setting?
19.03.19 23:21:07<stoopkid> probably like 10 at least i would think?
19.03.19 23:21:11<stoopkid> but idk
19.03.19 23:23:03<stoopkid> we definitely want the content boxes to expand to fit their content as a guaranteed fail-gracefully but we should probably be having content stay inside the screen altogether, but then again idk
19.03.19 23:23:27<editable-dog>i think thats kinda like asking whats the minimum level of sight that people can have
19.03.19 23:24:06<editable-dog>idk, having to scroll horizontally doesnt seem so bad
19.03.19 23:24:22<stoopkid> or at what point people just use a screen-reader instead of trying to read visually
19.03.19 23:24:50<editable-dog>yeah maybe
19.03.19 23:25:30<editable-dog>i think we shouldnt spend too much time on it 
19.03.19 23:25:31<stoopkid> also i think i've seen that people sometimes get like a magnifying glass app so they can just hover-over what they want to magnify
19.03.19 23:25:58<editable-dog>yeah that makes sense on a pc
19.03.19 23:26:32<editable-dog>maybe if i ever come with some accessibility-specific business plan/opportunity, then we can pursue it further
19.03.19 23:28:17<stoopkid> megan works for a dyslexia non-profit so i could ask her if they have any style-guides for that kind of thing
19.03.19 23:28:51<editable-dog>ah nice
19.03.19 23:29:33<editable-dog>i suppose there arent style guides for dyslexia, but disgraphia or something, they have like special fonts
19.03.19 23:29:37<stoopkid> it probably makes sense for me to focus on it a little more since it's more of a front-end design thing, like having answers to some of these questions would definitely just make the job easier so i don't have to thin about it
19.03.19 23:29:41<stoopkid> think*
19.03.19 23:30:43<stoopkid> ex. half of my issue is just knowing how the browsers are even computing the layout for different zooms to begin with
19.03.19 23:31:59<editable-dog>here you go https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/design-website-for-blind/
19.03.19 23:32:32<stoopkid> so i probably want to at least master that & have a couple different options available (ex. zoom by layout vs. pixel-wise zoom) just to round out my CSS expertise and then hopefully i'll be able to plop in an actual accessibility solution whenever we figure that out
19.03.19 23:32:40* stoopkid looking
19.03.19 23:36:52<editable-dog>seems like more of a legal faq than meaty accesibility resource
19.03.19 23:42:20<stoopkid> i would say that in firefox it works at all screen-sizes for all zoom-levels up to 170%, and in chrome up to 200%
19.03.19 23:46:11<editable-dog>i think its nice
19.03.19 23:55:01<editable-dog>so, gridsome-starter-blog/node_modules/gridsome/app/entry.client.js
19.03.19 23:55:12<editable-dog>let Vue router handle internal URLs for anchors in innerHTML
                 <editable-dog>document.addEventListener('click', event => {
19.03.19 23:55:15<editable-dog>....
19.03.19 23:55:50<editable-dog> router.push(location)
                 <editable-dog>  event.preventDefault()
19.03.19 23:56:06<stoopkid> nice
19.03.19 23:56:40<editable-dog>the problem is router.push fails, because deep down, theres a check on the equality of the current and new route
19.03.19 23:57:04<editable-dog>gridsome-starter-blog/node_modules/vue-router/dist/vue-router.esm.js
19.03.19 23:57:39<editable-dog>if (
                 <editable-dog>    isSameRoute(route, current) &&
                 <editable-dog>    // in the case the route map has been dynamically appended to
                 <editable-dog>    route.matched.length === current.matched.length
19.03.19 23:57:40<editable-dog>  ) {
                 <editable-dog>    this.ensureURL();
                 <editable-dog>    return abort()
19.03.19 23:59:21<editable-dog>idk if we can figure out if the authors considered the situation we have, if we're doing a wrong thing, or whatever
20.03.19 00:00:19<stoopkid> i don't think we're doing a wrong thing but it might be something gridsome's doing that vue could be more flexible about
20.03.19 00:01:10<editable-dog>otoh i think it would be trivial to add a property to our link elements, and check it in the click handler and avoid the preventDefault, but we should only avoid it if router.push fails. Maybe the right thing to do could be to propagate the abort from the equality test all the way up here? idk
20.03.19 00:03:43<stoopkid> it seems more like we want to modify that abort to only abort the routing if it doesn't have "#.." component, or configure gridsome to configure vue to do that, if possible
20.03.19 00:06:31<editable-dog>im doubtful there are any configuration directives in this regard
20.03.19 00:06:56<editable-dog>but yeah thats another fairly trivial modification we could make
20.03.19 00:07:47<stoopkid> maybe we should take it up w/ the vue devs to get their thoughts before investing too much of our own time on it though
20.03.19 00:08:28<editable-dog>i'll probably be content with leaving everything as it is now, maybe the right way will present itself when we acquire more of the basics of vue

20.03.19 00:08:37<editable-dog>yeah 
20.03.19 00:18:32<editable-dog>well, good job everyone, see you tomorrow at 5am
20.03.19 01:29:52<stoopkid> so i'm finding that in firefox, they measure pixels as a relative thing, and in chrome they measure pixels as an absolute thing (at least as far as what shows up in developer tools)
20.03.19 01:33:53<stoopkid> well hrm i'm not sure what all i might've done to change it from what a user would see by default or w/ their own configured font (if anything) but i seem to be able to come up with basic heuristics about what will be a reasonable screen size based on font-size
20.03.19 01:35:13<stoopkid> like on the current font, the magic formula for firefox is that whatever actual screen-width corresponds to ~340 firefox pixels will be the minimum screen width for displaying at that zoom-size without horizontal overflow or ridiculously small columns
20.03.19 01:36:54<stoopkid> on chrome the magic formula seems to be that for every ~25% zoom you need ~80 more chrome pixels to accommodate it, with ~350px accommodating the text at 100% zoom

20.03.19 08:05:51<editable-dog>yo
20.03.19 08:05:59<stoopkid_> yo
20.03.19 08:06:12<editable-dog>another round?
20.03.19 08:06:42<stoopkid_> did we decide on what?
20.03.19 08:07:06<stoopkid_> i've been converting the front-end from bootstrap to flexbox
20.03.19 08:07:22<stoopkid_> it's a lot easier lol
20.03.19 08:13:23<editable-dog>nice
20.03.19 08:13:28<editable-dog>we havent
20.03.19 08:27:43<editable-dog>doing a little cms research
20.03.19 09:14:40<editable-dog>butterCMS...not too impressed
20.03.19 10:18:37<editable-dog>ok so these are CMS's...i think we both have in mind something more like a WYSIWYG site editor
20.03.19 10:28:41<editable-dog>haha https://www.staticgen.com/
20.03.19 10:30:01<editable-dog>ok, well, im gonna try out one or two wysiwyg site builders another day
20.03.19 10:30:10<editable-dog>bored out of my head with this stuff
20.03.19 10:30:26<editable-dog>hows it going over there?
20.03.19 10:31:11<stoopkid_> going alright just trying to take some basic control over css
20.03.19 10:32:57<editable-dog>im somewhat intrigued by ButterCMS business model...they charge per admin user/page count and similar metrics, which have nothing to do with their costs, which are the CDN service they use and their infrastructure and im pretty sure go up with number of users of and nature of their customers sites
20.03.19 10:33:04<editable-dog>hehe
20.03.19 10:35:12<editable-dog>im not sure if they found a nice way to make it possible to overcharge by hiding away their actual costs, or if they have a disaster just waiting to happen
20.03.19 10:44:23<editable-dog>is megan still so opposed to immortal monkey?
20.03.19 10:44:54<editable-dog>https://cz.pinterest.com/pin/84512930483263965/ i think this would be a great start of a logo
20.03.19 11:19:44<editable-dog>i kinda hoped/imagined these cms's might do more, but its just edit page template, create page, upload picture, fetch list of pages with api
20.03.19 11:20:31<editable-dog>i mean, i wasnt sure sure whats the cms/wysiwyg builder line
20.03.19 11:28:07<editable-dog>hmm what is the significance of window.__theme in the dark/light switcher script?
20.03.19 11:28:37<editable-dog>is this picked up by some css?
20.03.19 11:29:48<editable-dog>ah found it
20.03.19 11:31:26<editable-dog>hm another task for me today that wont require too much mental efforts is checking freelancer sites for interesting jobs again
20.03.19 11:35:35<stoopkid_> maybe something like this one? https://www.istockphoto.com/se/vektor/cute-new-year-postcard-year-of-the-monkey-year-2016-gm495346206-77940297
20.03.19 11:37:36<stoopkid_> we could mess with people and just have some animal that's not even a monkey
20.03.19 11:40:23<editable-dog>lol
20.03.19 11:41:34<editable-dog>if we ever play with the light/dark thing, it would be nice to try to integrate it with https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/cssref/altstyles/index.html
20.03.19 11:43:02<editable-dog>what the
20.03.19 11:43:16<editable-dog>https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alt-css/deaodobjfcolfhkecnnghdclnlmfjdje
20.03.19 11:44:03<editable-dog>this thing doesnt display any options on the previous link, but it shows a "base" and "none" dropdown on our site
20.03.19 11:44:31<editable-dog>oh it needed a reload
20.03.19 11:44:44<editable-dog>it works even on that example page
20.03.19 11:44:45<editable-dog>nice
20.03.19 12:04:03<editable-dog>i tried copying our html and css into this.. http://selfcss.org/ , unsurprisingly doesnt seem to work
20.03.19 12:31:05<editable-dog>i guess when youre an estabilished company, bidding on freelancer might be a good way to make sure clients will just go to your site and contact you through there
20.03.19 12:44:47<editable-dog>so, does switching from bootstrap to flexbox change things wrt to extreme zoomin?
20.03.19 12:46:03<stoopkid_> a little bit; i got the "containers not fitting to content" issue solved, at least for now
20.03.19 12:46:15<editable-dog>nice
20.03.19 16:04:05<editable-dog>(re)-watching vue videos
20.03.19 16:13:18<stoopkid_> this layout's pretty nice so far: https://github.com/sto0pkid/WebLayouts/blob/master/BasicFlexboxStickyFooter/center-rainbow-styling2.html
20.03.19 17:12:32<stoopkid_> i think i need to work on some more link styles heh
20.03.19 18:55:19<editable-dog>gonna go sleep early today
20.03.19 19:01:27<editable-dog>got some errands tomorrow afternoon, but if you plan on continuing, then i figure i could just tag along in whatever youre gonna be doing, for a couple of hours
20.03.19 19:01:45<editable-dog>if we dont decide on the next big thing to tackle
20.03.19 19:04:42<editable-dog>and i guess i still want to spend some more time on the proof trace visualizer, i almost got bnodes displaying, and when thats done, i'd be adding a new component for displaying lists 
20.03.19 19:05:25<editable-dog>so i figure you might want to get involved while this thing is still fairly simple
20.03.19 19:05:41<editable-dog>for some vue-ing
20.03.19 19:16:34<editable-dog>still got a couple of loose ends here that ill want to tie before diving into something big and new
21.03.19 04:59:18<editable-dog>yo
21.03.19 07:00:22<editable-dog>did you register the immortalmonkey gmail? coz its taken
21.03.19 13:34:22<stoopkid_> wasn't me; wow sorry i got here so late today, i'd only slept 3-4 hours the past two nights so i guess last night my body was trying to catch up cause i slept for like 14 hours straight through all my alarms..
21.03.19 13:53:29<editable-dog>hey
21.03.19 13:54:04<editable-dog>yeah i figured youre catching up, im not too well rested myself
21.03.19 13:55:01<editable-dog>and i had errands today anyway, only just sat down now, and still cant be sure when kids will come invading
21.03.19 13:56:32<stoopkid_> so i guess maybe we should just have a light day today with the main goal of just making sure we don't stay up until forever hehe
21.03.19 14:04:08<stoopkid_> so a couple conclusions after messing w/ HTML/CSS.. first is we should definitely define our own abstraction layers (in like JSON/RDF or something) such that we can describe a website in our own human-level terms, and get to the point that we can put together a site just by setting configurations in these layers
21.03.19 14:06:08<stoopkid_> wrt flexible design, it seems the only limitation w/ making a site responsively flexible is size of necessary text & images
21.03.19 14:08:14<stoopkid_> including on the technical side, CSS seems to allow some pretty arbitrary configurations for responsive design, like w/ flexbox i can have the site smoothly switch between like 10 different layouts in between phone sizes and desktop sizes
21.03.19 14:08:51<editable-dog>i finally found time to sit down, was kinda preparing for doing something together, but i could also go spend some time with kids and socialize and stuff idk
21.03.19 14:09:23<editable-dog>you definitely deserve a light day, i kinda had a light day yesterday
21.03.19 14:10:54<stoopkid_> nah we can do something let's just try not to ruin our schedule w/ it heh
21.03.19 14:12:07<editable-dog>wrt abstractions, in the short run, im still hoping i can find some reasonable wysiwyg website builder
21.03.19 14:12:44<editable-dog>but on the more wild side, ive shown you the inform7 site generator, right?
21.03.19 14:16:38<stoopkid_> looks interesting
21.03.19 14:24:13<stoopkid_> what would be perfect imo is something like a nodejs package that gridsome will run during develop that would allow you to make editable versions of each component/layout/page
21.03.19 14:29:41<stoopkid_> so maybe that could be our goal today, see if we can make gridsome read our own json configuration files and display a site from them, and then see if we can have it respond to a form submission by updating the page and writing to the config files
21.03.19 14:30:05<stoopkid_> and then build a page from that which doesn't include the interactivity
21.03.19 14:30:23<stoopkid_> (and is maybe even stripped of all js :)
21.03.19 14:31:58<stoopkid_> that's personally how i would want to build a website ideally
21.03.19 14:32:41<stoopkid_> really my browser should just be able to do that already w/o extensions but.. they make it difficult
21.03.19 14:33:55<stoopkid_> makes me wonder if somebody's built a browser over nodejs yet
21.03.19 14:40:53<stoopkid_> i guess you could do it purely in the browser by just saving a page that contains the json updates and then extracting it back out later in the build process
21.03.19 14:44:48<editable-dog>hmm sounds like good ideas, but i'll need clarifications
21.03.19 14:45:50<editable-dog>do you imagine just a text editor for the definitions of components/pages, or something more wysiwyg?
21.03.19 14:47:43<stoopkid_> something more wysiwyg but the server should store the configurations as some static json or something for the build to use
21.03.19 14:48:14<editable-dog>what kind of information do you envision in the json
21.03.19 14:49:41<stoopkid_> site content & configurations, color / font selections for various components, etc..
21.03.19 14:52:07<stoopkid_> like, given some layout, all the predefined ways you can customize that layout that would be exposed through some wysiwyg
21.03.19 14:56:12<stoopkid_> basically anything that we would expose as a parameter of a given site design, as opposed to the portion of the HTML/CSS that has to be there to host these parameters
21.03.19 14:56:56<editable-dog>i still dont know...something at the level like my site generator, like "sidebar on left/sidebar on right"?
21.03.19 14:57:50<editable-dog>now site name is "Webik";
                 <editable-dog>move search box to header;
                 <editable-dog>move links to right sidebar;
21.03.19 14:57:51<editable-dog>now number of excerpts is 10;
21.03.19 14:57:52<editable-dog>now number of words in excerpts is 10;
21.03.19 15:00:10<stoopkid_> sure, if that's a parameter exposed in the design, it's basically just what is the schema for the set of predefined ways to configure the site (or potentially a site in general, depending on how generalized our predefined configurations are)
21.03.19 15:01:01<editable-dog>yeah that are the user-configurable parameters
21.03.19 15:10:14<stoopkid_> so i'm thinking like, in vue ex. you've got everything for a component all bundled together in a .vue file, the editable version of a component should basically be bundled up w/ that, and then be composed into the layout in the same way as the original component
21.03.19 15:11:45<stoopkid_> so each component is an object that comes w/ some parameters, and the editable version is a form that talks to the server and sets those parameters
21.03.19 15:15:49<stoopkid_> so then when you compose some site, you're always already composing the wysiwyg editable version, and doing it in the same language(s) you're already doing everything else in
21.03.19 15:23:44<editable-dog>if you mean just moving the editing of the component source from a native text editor to a web text editor, that dosent change much i'd say
21.03.19 15:28:49<stoopkid_> not exactly, i mean actual wysiwyg editing, so ex. if editing background color is a parameter you want to make user-configurable you might have a standard way that a color-wheel widget (or just a simple textbox letting you put in an RGBA code) can be integrated into any site layout so that when you say you want to make color editable all the wysiwyg functionality is already integrated
21.03.19 15:31:01<editable-dog>ok, color's an easy one
21.03.19 15:31:45<stoopkid_> well, i don't think any parameters that would be generally user-configurable would be that challenging
21.03.19 15:32:11<editable-dog>but im missing the big picture wrt layout, data integration, whatever other logic, features
21.03.19 15:32:36<editable-dog>like for example the fix for same-page hrefs 
21.03.19 15:32:49<editable-dog>thats something i'd want expressed declaratively
21.03.19 15:33:00<editable-dog>i mean, if even just for us
21.03.19 15:33:45<editable-dog>theres this feature whis is this fix, when it's turned on, there's some change to some code somewhere..
21.03.19 15:34:00<editable-dog>hey i gotta run again for a hour or so
21.03.19 15:38:15<stoopkid_> so i guess it depends on how you personally conceive of this as a parameter, i.e. if it's something that should be individually modifiable per-link or is just a global fix for making links work properly and that it shouldn't ever be disabled
21.03.19 15:39:16<stoopkid_> but this is maybe a good example of what i mean, we don't want to express this in terms of "their" logic, we want it to be expressed in terms of our logic
21.03.19 15:40:26<stoopkid_> so the "fix" isn't the feature, the feature is whether or not same-page hrefs will jump back to where they're supposed to if you click them twice
21.03.19 15:41:12<stoopkid_> if this should be a user-customizable feature, the default should probably be true and apply globally to all links, i'd say
21.03.19 15:41:30<stoopkid_> then how we manifest that configuration into reality is something we should handle elsewhere
21.03.19 15:47:14<stoopkid_> so wrt big picture wrt layout, data integration, etc.. let's say you have a "blog-post" feature on your site
21.03.19 15:47:53<stoopkid_> in HTML/CSS whatever that might be a thousand lines of layout template and styling options
21.03.19 15:48:45<stoopkid_> but we probably have way fewer user-configurable parameters
21.03.19 15:50:36<stoopkid_> whatever is that schema of user-configurable parameters, we should have an actual schema corresponding to it, like a set of json fields associated w/ human readable names
21.03.19 15:51:39<stoopkid_> wrt that schema, it's composed of.. say.. a header, a subheading w/ date & author, and then an "article"
21.03.19 15:52:30<stoopkid_> each of these things should be editable
21.03.19 15:53:55<stoopkid_> like wysiwyg you click on the header and it transforms into a textbox letting you input the heading text, select font stylings etc..
21.03.19 15:54:18<stoopkid_> and etc.. for each of the other components
21.03.19 15:55:58<stoopkid_> wrt to the layout of "blog-post", we should be able to express it just a single time
21.03.19 15:56:25<stoopkid_> just the equivalent of <header/> <subheading/> <article/>
21.03.19 15:57:49<stoopkid_> and this should automatically account for the wysiwyg editing of "blog-post" unless we have something specific to the layout of blog-posts beyond whatever already comes packaged with the editing for header/subheading/article
21.03.19 16:01:45<stoopkid_> so that's basically the idea, you have component A, which comes in A-static and A-editable forms, then you make component B which just simply includes A, and B should automatically be wysiwyg editable by giving you access to A's editable version
21.03.19 16:06:35<stoopkid_> so then this basically corresponds to some json object:
21.03.19 16:09:31<stoopkid_> B { name-of-A-object: A; ...other values specific to B...}
21.03.19 16:10:58<stoopkid_> this is like a schema for B so let's say A included header/subheading/article its schema object would be:
21.03.19 16:11:37<stoopkid_> A { header-for-A: Header; subheading-for-A: Subheading; article-for-A: Article }
21.03.19 16:13:36<stoopkid_> so now you can have objects like my-obj-A { header-for-A: ..header value... ; subheading-for-A: ...subheading value...; article-for-A: ... article value ... }
21.03.19 16:18:02<stoopkid_> so let's say B was Site and A was Blog-Post
21.03.19 16:19:30<stoopkid_> when you wysiwyg edit Blog-Post you'll just be making edits to a json object my-site.my-blog-post
21.03.19 16:20:12<stoopkid_> or rather, that will be the result of wysiwyg editing
21.03.19 16:38:27<stoopkid_> so basically each human-level component should have all of the following (or equivalents of them) bundled together: a vue template for its static version, a vue template for its editable version, a json schema representing the user-configurable options for the component, and the js code that the server can use to expose the methods that handle responding to the wysiwyg interaction (both browser & server-side)
21.03.19 16:44:53<stoopkid_> wrt the editable vs. static versions of content, it should basically be like they're just two different stylings of the same DOM
21.03.19 16:45:04<stoopkid_> not precisely, but the same analogy
21.03.19 16:46:04<stoopkid_> so any layout that includes component A should be able to work with both the static layout and the editable layout for A
21.03.19 16:47:05<stoopkid_> so if B includes A, we don't need to make a separate editable B that includes editable A, B should just say it includes A, and then be able to work with both the static and editable versions of A without any further modification
21.03.19 16:49:33<stoopkid_> you *can* then add an editable version of B for editing things specific to B, and the editable layout for B should also be able to just say it includes A, and accommodate both the static and editable versions without any further modification
21.03.19 16:51:35<stoopkid_> and further it should just already be equipped to talk to the server to send its modifications, without any further configuration
21.03.19 16:52:30<stoopkid_> so basically you should just be able to write:
21.03.19 16:52:43<stoopkid_> <template>
21.03.19 16:52:50<stoopkid_>  <Header>
21.03.19 16:52:56<stoopkid_> <Subheading>
21.03.19 16:52:58<stoopkid_> <Article>
21.03.19 16:53:01<stoopkid_> </template>
21.03.19 16:54:33<stoopkid_> and automatically get a site that's already wysiwyg editable by exposing whatever whatever wysiwyg editing functionality is already available in each of <Header> <Subheading> and <Article>
21.03.19 18:23:06<editable-dog>yeah absolutely
21.03.19 18:23:35<editable-dog>so one thing we need is to research how to access global variables from components in vue
21.03.19 18:23:47<editable-dog>or i might have already done it and im just confused about it
21.03.19 18:24:52<editable-dog>one way might be to create a mixin class to be added to the component class idk
21.03.19 18:25:57<editable-dog>anyway, once a component knows if it's in design or production mode, it can display the editing widgets on demand
21.03.19 18:26:32<editable-dog>we prolly want to add a section like the "data" one
21.03.19 18:26:59<editable-dog>for specifying what can be edited and what type it has
21.03.19 18:27:35<editable-dog>im thinking the easiest way to tie everything to some persistency mechanism might be the vuex thing or something like that
21.03.19 18:28:33<editable-dog>whatever's editable in the template or style sections would just reference some variable from the store i suppose
21.03.19 18:28:47<editable-dog>and we just need to specify that this variable should be editable

21.03.19 19:02:03<editable-dog>its not trivial to combine our overlap time with normal life(TM)
21.03.19 19:05:25<stoopkid_> should we aim for 5am my time again?
21.03.19 19:09:03<editable-dog>hmm no clue
21.03.19 19:09:17<editable-dog>might be more advantageous for me tomorrow to start later
21.03.19 19:09:18<editable-dog>idk
21.03.19 19:10:46<stoopkid_> well i guess i'll aim to be up at 5 so that we can start whenever
21.03.19 19:28:23<editable-dog>data: ()=> {
21.03.19 19:28:24<editable-dog>return {

                 <editable-dog>}
21.03.19 19:28:36<editable-dog>ok thats one proper way to access a global i guess

22.03.19 08:53:13<stoopkid__> so here's the issue i'm currently having wrt wrestling html/css down to something sane
22.03.19 08:54:18<stoopkid__> say you want a div to expand vertically to fit its content, i.e. it expands instead of overflows
22.03.19 08:54:55<stoopkid__> it will actually automatically do that
22.03.19 08:55:11<stoopkid__> now let's say the content has content
22.03.19 08:55:38<stoopkid__> so div A contains div B which contains div C
22.03.19 08:55:54<stoopkid__> let's say div C overflows B, this won't be accounted for by A
22.03.19 08:56:52<stoopkid__> so A will expand to accommodate its child elements, ex. B, but it won't expand to accommodate its grandchild elements, ex. C and later descendants
22.03.19 09:09:04<stoopkid__> in general things shouldn't overflow their containers but there might be some situations where it's called for and as we've seen it's something that can happen by accident so our layouts should be designed to be as accommodating as possible
22.03.19 09:10:44<stoopkid__> in that regard i'm thinking that in general the right side of the page should be left empty just in case some text content is not formatted properly and overflows to the right
22.03.19 09:13:02<stoopkid__> and with this thing w/ the divs not expanding to the size of their grandchild divs, if there's a fix for that it should be applied on essentially every single div that doesn't intentionally have some overflow as part of the design
22.03.19 09:32:29<editable-dog>whats the css attribute that enables the stretch-to-child behavior?
22.03.19 09:35:57<stoopkid__> (most) divs automatically stretch/shrink vertically to fit children and stretch/shrink horizontally to fill parent, unless other settings are applied
22.03.19 09:36:35<editable-dog>hmm
22.03.19 09:38:05<editable-dog>so how are you making them stretch horizontally to contain children?
22.03.19 09:49:40<stoopkid__> display: flex on the parent seems to work for some examples, although it can have side-effects
22.03.19 09:52:25<editable-dog>any other methods? or do we just apply this attribute to every div and its done?
22.03.19 10:13:55<editable-dog>anyway
22.03.19 10:13:59<editable-dog>we have a job
22.03.19 10:14:39<stoopkid__> oh yea? can you paste the link

22.03.19 10:15:13<editable-dog>they actually charge your credit card their service fee when you accept the job
22.03.19 10:15:47<stoopkid__> i see
22.03.19 10:15:58<editable-dog>im in some tmuxes on azure

22.03.19 10:20:35<editable-dog>yeah
22.03.19 10:24:55<editable-dog>i need a bit to collect my thoughts
22.03.19 10:25:22<stoopkid__> so what exactly is the job?
22.03.19 10:27:47<editable-dog>its a business card wysiwyg editor like the canva thing, and the guy said there are two arrays of objects, one for texts and oe for images, and that's messing up the editing, they want us to redesign it so that all the objects are in one array
22.03.19 10:29:45<editable-dog>idk if this is something that makes sense for you to dive into, im thinking i'm managing by myself so far, but if you're in, its throwing some error when you try to register
22.03.19 10:32:06<stoopkid__> i would be down but i guess i'll leave that up to your judgement
22.03.19 10:34:21<editable-dog>well, together's more fun
22.03.19 10:36:35<stoopkid__> sure
22.03.19 10:38:58<stoopkid__> is there a default user for this site?
22.03.19 10:42:01<editable-dog>¯\_(ツ)_/¯
22.03.19 10:42:23<editable-dog>django has some system of database fixtures, i'd look there
22.03.19 10:43:35<stoopkid__> well i made a user and logged in at least, so what's the broken feature exactly?
22.03.19 10:44:24<editable-dog>all i know is that the two arrays are messing with editing, i suppose it gives problems when selecing objects, wrt z-index
22.03.19 10:44:43<stoopkid__> what two arrays?
22.03.19 10:44:59<editable-dog>there are supposed to be two arrays, one for text one for images
22.03.19 10:45:02<editable-dog>idk where exactly
22.03.19 10:47:31<editable-dog>you manged to register?
22.03.19 10:47:51<stoopkid__> yea it gave some error but it still made an account
22.03.19 10:47:57<editable-dog>oh
22.03.19 10:49:23<editable-dog>so, i know ive brought this up a lot of times already, but can we do skype, or would you prefer not to? i think it would make things smoother

                 <editable-dog>Web based SVG online document creation application prototype to be completed.
                 <editable-dog>Redesign if needed.
                 <editable-dog>Duration: 2 month
                 <editable-dog>Milestones:
                 <editable-dog>a) UI screens - 1 weeks
                 <editable-dog>b) Application: 1.5 months
                 <editable-dog>c) Test and Validation: 1 week
                 <editable-dog>Description:
                 <editable-dog>The utility is a web based one that makes use of google draw type of layout to add design widgets onto a white screen(eg. a visiting card) The design widgets can be text or drawing elements and can be transparent or solid
22.03.19 11:40:50<editable-dog>Currently, SVG APIs are used for the drawing elements. The code uses JSON lists to keep track of all the elements and make sure that the stack of elements (editable is on top of stack) is maintained. The error in the code is that the JSON for text and drawing elements are separately maintained instead of a single interleaved list due to which edits of stacked elements on the visiting card canvas dont work (eg logo on a visting card not
                 <editable-dog>getting updates). The work involves fixing these issues.
22.03.19 11:42:41<editable-dog>[...]
22.03.19 11:42:42<editable-dog>Just want to make sure we are on the same page with regards to the scope of the job, that we cannot produce more than the redesign and maybe a few fixes, on this budget

                 <editable-dog>yes understood
22.03.19 11:42:43<editable-dog>Congratulations, your bid has been awarded!
22.03.19 11:43:12<editable-dog>If i understand correctly, you mainly need the datastructure redesign, to make editing work as expected. The milestones you write in project descriptions are very broad.

22.03.19 14:28:11<sirccloud> So i guess lets try making moving elements forth and back properly, merge the json arrays, and ask for our money?
22.03.19 14:28:39<stoopkid__> sounds about right? idk
22.03.19 14:28:47<stoopkid__> i'm pretty far along w/ moving elements back & forth
22.03.19 14:29:21<sirccloud> Awesome
22.03.19 14:34:11<stoopkid__> it basically works but for some reason it sometimes only moves them by 1 instead of by 2
22.03.19 14:34:55<stoopkid__> i'm thinking this is related to why i'm having to do .previousSibling.previousSibling instead of just .previousSibling
22.03.19 14:35:15<stoopkid__> maybe some hidden divs i'm not seeing in the browser tools
22.03.19 14:35:29<stoopkid__> like :before/:after pseudo-selectors or something
22.03.19 15:06:17<stoopkid__> ok well
22.03.19 15:06:20<stoopkid__> i think it works
22.03.19 15:10:06<stoopkid__> now just to merge the json arrays and ask for our money?
22.03.19 15:13:42<stoopkid__> are they reading this json or just writing it?
22.03.19 15:16:51<stoopkid__> i think i'm getting a guess at what they might be going for here
22.03.19 15:20:57<editable-dog>yo
22.03.19 15:20:59<editable-dog>half-here
22.03.19 15:21:41<stoopkid__> i think since svg works off order of elements in DOM, they're trying to load up a json file with all the elements and have it maintain stack, but loading from two arrays doesn't do that, so they want one array already interleaved
22.03.19 15:23:56<stoopkid__> that should be a pretty easy fix in the makeJSON routine i'm thinking?
22.03.19 15:30:22<editable-dog>yeah yeah
22.03.19 15:30:28<editable-dog>i'd think both reading and writing
22.03.19 15:30:39<editable-dog>we gotta fix all the templates they already have i guess
22.03.19 15:51:30<editable-dog>idk, do we wanna rely on the exact way the elements are interleaved there? cant we just go through everything and test the type
22.03.19 15:54:59<stoopkid__> let's fix that up after it works at all?
22.03.19 15:55:10<editable-dog>no prob
22.03.19 15:55:13<stoopkid__> unless you already know how to do the check
22.03.19 15:55:27<editable-dog>we just check the elements class?
22.03.19 15:59:58<editable-dog>why worry about these rects at all? are there some texts that arent a part of the edited businesscard and you tell that by the absence of a rect?
22.03.19 16:02:00<stoopkid__> well the makeJSON extracts info from the rects associated with the texts so this is more just some basic type-checking that we actually have a well-formed text component, hypothetically we would maybe throw some error handling around this just in case we don't, but.. meh
22.03.19 16:02:24<editable-dog>a
22.03.19 16:02:26<editable-dog>ah
22.03.19 16:03:00<stoopkid__> there's probably some more assertions we should throw on here like that the id's correspond
22.03.19 16:04:53<editable-dog>yeah probably worth it
22.03.19 16:06:36<editable-dog>where exactly does it use the rect? i cant find it in the makeJSON functions
22.03.19 16:08:44<editable-dog>i see

22.03.19 17:39:57<editable-dog>line 98
22.03.19 17:40:04<editable-dog>is how the svg element is populated
22.03.19 18:12:41<editable-dog>hahah, so theres actually more saving code on the python side, im getting the hang of it but its a mess, basically what it does is the entries in the template have a holder field with the id of the text/image item, and it goes through the json you are sending and adjusts the items in the template in a loop that looks like it could have been made specifically to keep the order of the items in the template entries array lol
22.03.19 18:13:12<editable-dog>i kinda deciphered the code, its not complex, but i still dont know what the intentions were here
22.03.19 18:14:02<editable-dog>but im figuring it would be a waste not to hack this somehow to make the saving and loading preserve the order
22.03.19 18:16:57<stoopkid__> well i think i got the moving-elements-back-and-forth all figured out & fixed up at least
22.03.19 18:18:15<editable-dog>cool

22.03.19 19:11:39<editable-dog>ok, entries order preserved but images disappear
22.03.19 19:45:42<editable-dog>getting bored of it
22.03.19 19:46:21<editable-dog>still quite a bit of code needs to be changed for the new design
22.03.19 19:46:47<editable-dog>so, we're saving order, but not accounting for images in entries

23.03.19 21:32:52<stoopkid__> "free^lancer.com is s*ht company run by idi^ots ev^en if it's an em^ployer's fault they don't give a s*hit and if you tr^y to reas^on with them you will get susp^ended the cust^omer supp*ort is a bunch of fili*pino mot*herfcker cun*ts"
24.03.19 06:31:21<editable-dog>i think theres some leveling off of the freelance charge with higher project $$$
24.03.19 06:33:56<editable-dog>err, i guess there isnt
24.03.19 06:34:27<editable-dog>yeah we should probably eventually start looking into the alternatives
24.03.19 06:34:33<editable-dog>toptal etc
24.03.19 06:35:43<editable-dog>wrt web scraping, getting set up is easy
24.03.19 06:35:51<editable-dog>but i dont think it actually ties into ldl
24.03.19 06:36:17<editable-dog>wrt refund, not so sure either
24.03.19 06:37:05<editable-dog>the common theme of complaints about freelancer is that they always favor the employer
24.03.19 21:10:53<stoopkid__> "but i dont think it actually ties into ldl" i think that all depends on how deep we get into the parsing of the underlying languages
24.03.19 21:11:48<stoopkid__> which could realistically be "arbitrarily deep"
24.03.19 21:12:36<stoopkid__> maybe it doesn't really tie into CNL but i think it's very much in line with LDL in the abstract at least
24.03.19 21:15:43<stoopkid__> there's a collection of languages we have to use and we would hypothetically want some kind of system for managing them, and that already puts us in "LDL territory"
24.03.19 21:17:14<stoopkid__> side-note: russian is such a wild language for somebody who only speaks english
24.03.19 21:19:01<stoopkid__> i think the only thing it's easier on is the written version of the language.. everything is pretty much written the way it sounds for the most part.. nothing like "right", they would pronounce the "gh".. nothing like "knife", they would pronounce the "k"..
24.03.19 21:19:53<stoopkid__> but verb conjugations? cases? genders? aspects?
24.03.19 21:28:25<stoopkid__> we don't change the underlying words for these 99% of the time we just use different word combinations
