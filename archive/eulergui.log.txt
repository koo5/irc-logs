0827174405<rszeno> i'm between you and you, :)
0827174554<sirdancealot> h i
0827174620<rszeno> hi
0827174829<rszeno> i didn't tryed iso-hunt yet but it look nice
0827174856<sirdancealot> :)
0827174953<rszeno> if i can download what i want then is perfect
0827175207<rszeno> btw, thank you for the link
0827175250<sirdancealot> np
0827175531<rszeno> what you are doing? still working to tau?
0827175544<sirdancealot> not on tau
0827175602<rszeno> trams tests?
0827175619<sirdancealot> today ive been fixing some small issue with newshit, but im distracted all day
0827175634<sirdancealot> yep tram tests most of all
0827175721<rszeno> automate the work as much as you could
0827175732<sirdancealot> the tram tests are now almost done and i should get my 30k czk soon
0827175756<sirdancealot> to automate it was my job:)
0827175820<rszeno> fine, about tests,:)
0827175841<sirdancealot> im a difficult situation now tho
0827175856<rszeno> can i help?
0827180125<sirdancealot> dunno. they offer me 40k for a full work week
0827180231<rszeno> and? you don't know what to do?
0827180234<sirdancealot> i want to work less, they are fine with that
0827180337<sirdancealot> well, i guess you cant help me with anything
0827180348<sirdancealot> also too much distraction here now
0827180504<rszeno> ok, mail me if you need help. Is not a certitude that i can but i will try.
0827180547<sirdancealot> writing mails is too hard:)
0827180556<rszeno> distraction is good, even if you try to avoid is necessary
0827180619<rszeno> writing mail? wow, :)
0827180728<rszeno> you don't need something formalized, just tell what is about, :)
0827180820<rszeno> mail is very good for me,:)
0827180902<rszeno> chating too but keep busy both parts
0827180927<sirdancealot> its that i wish i had been writing my work hours this past month
0827181034<sirdancealot> yeah but when i think about a problem its often impossible to formulate fully
0827181041<rszeno> a kind of deary/log
0827181120<rszeno> doesn't matter when i don't understand i ask,:)
0827181321<rszeno> i use to log everything so even if i forget is there
0827181401<sirdancealot> while True:
0827181402<sirdancealot> 	time.sleep(2)
          <sirdancealot> 	os.system("scrot  -q 80 /home/kook/screenshots/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).png")
0827181403<sirdancealot> :)
0827181512<rszeno> well, is good but to often and hard to search,:)
0827181625<sirdancealot> a few gb per day
0827181632<rszeno> using toolbox is a must,:)
0827181654<rszeno> grep, find, ...
0827181801<rszeno> actualy when you need will become more complex
0827181843<rszeno> n3 is good for me, :)
0827181916<sirdancealot> will be nice when i can actually make any use of n3 like that
0827182028<rszeno> all you need is to put everything as a n3 description first
0827182101<rszeno> then to use a reasoner to infere or find what you need
0827182113<sirdancealot> yes thats the theory
0827182214<rszeno> no, is practice. First time i seen this 16 years ago
0827182250<rszeno> Dan Connaly, spmebody from w3c
0827182344<rszeno> mail, sites, every piece of info
0827182517<rszeno> Tim Bernard Lee is another example,:)
0827182619<rszeno> anyway is not very easy but is not impossible
0827182628<sirdancealot> i know
0827182839<rszeno> are a lot of missing tools to make n3 from everything but ... i done a lot, both they done too
0827183106<rszeno> http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
0827183243<rszeno> Mad Mode is his site right now
0827183555<sirdancealot> probably good stuff there
0827183740<rszeno> depend on topic,:) but yes at least are good ideas to follow
0827183933<rszeno> a search on the web will show a lot of his contributions
0827184056<sirdancealot> my second problem: newshit is a total mess
0827184143<rszeno> missing planning?
0827184225<sirdancealot> i dont know better designs
0827184242<rszeno> usualy mess is a consequnce of planning
0827184248<sirdancealot> the code stays up to date with my knowledge
0827184256<sirdancealot> its the knowledge thats lacking:)
0827184318<rszeno> about what? domain?
0827184422<sirdancealot> programming language
0827184437<sirdancealot> formal language in general
0827184521<rszeno> define the problem, maybe i could help
0827184549<sirdancealot> the problem is very broad
0827184625<sirdancealot> have you seen any newshit screenshots lately?
0827184643<rszeno> no, can I?
0827184929<sirdancealot> just a minute..
0827184949<rszeno> np
0827185053<sirdancealot> http://i.imgur.com/m6soQ9g.png
0827185233<rszeno> what's in the left and right sides?
0827185242<sirdancealot> right shows a menu
0827185255<sirdancealot> autocomplete menu basically
0827185322<sirdancealot> left is a tree-structured ui/shell/editor/anything
0827185430<rszeno> ok, what is the problem?
0827185439<sirdancealot> hehe
0827185441<sirdancealot> the language
0827185505<sirdancealot> i have no clue what im doing
0827185622<rszeno> left side are bash commands?
0827185646<sirdancealot> no, its "the language"
0827185701<sirdancealot> its just mostly bash calls there
0827185717<sirdancealot> i have a function definition and a call
0827185759<rszeno> try to focus on concepts and their relations
0827185910<rszeno> a bash command is a string, you can describe it using a kernel of words ( concepts and relations )
0827185946<rszeno> a language is only a set of concepts and some rules
0827190031<rszeno> a most general name for 'bash' is 'shell' :)
0827190051<rszeno> so what is a shell?
0827190209<rszeno> some keywords and a set of rules to decide what to do with something called arguments
0827190311<rszeno> you didn't start backwords?
0827190413<rszeno> i mean identifying parts ( words ) before isolating concepts?
0827190509<rszeno> right side look like a frequency of some input
0827190547<sirdancealot> there is some sorting by relevance and similarity to what is typed in
0827190634<rszeno> who decide what is relevant and/or similar and how?
0827190653<sirdancealot> parsing results thrown in too
0827190702<sirdancealot> textual similarity by levenshtein distance
0827190719<sirdancealot> and theres a kind of type system / syntax system
0827190745<sirdancealot> on the screenshot the parameter is expected to be a number
0827190822<sirdancealot> so number gets good score if it parses
0827190954<rszeno> you want to deal with unpredictable input or is a given gramatical structure?
0827191022<sirdancealot> given
0827191110<sirdancealot> dealing with unpredictable input would be cool but its not current domain/focus
0827191121<rszeno> so everything will end, after parsing, with a tree
0827191134<sirdancealot> right
0827191141<sirdancealot> or a few trees
0827191203<rszeno> with all elements of known types and values
0827191210<sirdancealot> yes
0827191321<rszeno> having multiple trees need to deal somehow with them. What you do?
0827191334<sirdancealot> menu:)
0827191400<rszeno> for each tree you have a menu?
0827191405<sirdancealot> its more of a theoretic problem for now, i ofc try to avoid ambiguity in practice
0827191414<sirdancealot> no, each parse tree becomes an item in the menu
0827191518<sirdancealot> i didnt yet implement a parser that would parse the whole document at once, only currently edited bit
0827191610<rszeno> that is ok, imo
0827191648<rszeno> kind of working session i suppose
0827191720<sirdancealot> i dont think structural editing is as necessary as i used to, but hey i built it and it kinda works, while the parser side still isnt finished
0827191731<sirdancealot> working session what do you mean?
0827191825<rszeno> today you use a document tommorow another, each is a working session
0827191840<rszeno> editing i mean
0827191851<rszeno> or what you do
0827191915<sirdancealot> i just ressurected this one after fixing some serialization problems:)
0827191936<sirdancealot> i tried to use this document for running stuff i usually run
0827192009<sirdancealot> i also mean it as a showcase of what newshit can do so far
0827192045<rszeno> what is doing in the end?
0827192148<sirdancealot> its a shell and a programming language and a notepad and a language for defining context free languages and writing stuff in them
0827192233<rszeno> ooops, :)
0827192257<rszeno> that's a huge task
0827192312<sirdancealot> its not a task its an accident:)
0827192330<sirdancealot> or, logical conclusion
0827192332<rszeno> how this?
0827192356<rszeno> is somehow my fault? :)
0827192426<sirdancealot> dunno, its my toy:)
0827192553<rszeno> is ok, np :) I asked if is my fault because i always insisted on grammars
0827192657<sirdancealot> my idea has always been to have a hard grammar
0827192719<rszeno> my zamolex is such a farmework, bendis is on top of it
0827192735<sirdancealot> zamolex?:)
0827192810<rszeno> sorry, zamolxe, is old work since '70
0827192856<sirdancealot> sounds old
0827192911<sirdancealot> framework for a language?
0827192917<rszeno> it take a given grammar and analyse it or transform
0827192955<rszeno> for any language from 3 to 0 in chomsky hierarhy
0827193050<rszeno> building a grammar from test or whatever is another story
0827193111<rszeno> text not test
0827193141<sirdancealot> im ok with defining grammars by hand for now:)
0827193339<sirdancealot> do you know about naproche or fmathl?
0827193355<rszeno> ok, not a problem, :) but is still a lot of theory in defining grammars and language
0827193408<rszeno> no i don't know
0827193429<rszeno> links? something?
0827193440<sirdancealot> http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/FMathL.html
0827193527<sirdancealot> they agree that a grammar and a type system can be one thing
0827193557<sirdancealot> at least one of them agree, i forgot which one:)
          <rszeno> aha, i use a sort of metamath for this ( instead of fmath)
0827193637<rszeno> a grammar, a type system and a formalism are equivalent
0827193723<rszeno> so once you use one is using any other of later
0827193758<rszeno> i use grammars, old school, :)
0827193922<rszeno> acualy, one view, mine, a grammar describe both the typing system and also the formal system
0827194002<sirdancealot> whats a formal system?
0827194101<rszeno> a set of variables names, another of rules and it's closure
0827194226<rszeno> once you define 'identifier' in a grammar you define the set of names used for variables
0827194323<sirdancealot> in the end i will go back to my messy Nodes and Nodecls and Refs and Varrefs..
0827194355<rszeno> and also how is builded, use for parsing, what it is, agregation, building compounds vars, etc
0827194435<rszeno> a grammar have basicly only terminals and nonterminals
0827194531<rszeno> so you can stay with this and define the rest base on it
0827194619<rszeno> actualy is not something 'better' whatever you do, imo
0827194749<rszeno> aha, Neumaier
0827195044<rszeno> too much matematica imo, it hide the unerstanding of the tasks, :)
0827195121<sirdancealot> :)
0827195155<rszeno> i'm talking about the CAS
0827195338<sirdancealot> by CAS you mean the proof checker part?
0827195410<rszeno> he use mathlab and mathematica, this confuse the students
0827195443<rszeno> CAS - computer algebra system, doing math with it
0827195525<sirdancealot> ok
0827195635<rszeno> is  better then maxima but maxima have the avantage of seeing its internals
0827195644<sirdancealot> i want to make money, not math:)
0827195722<rszeno> one way is to automate work, :)
          <sirdancealot> you should get an android device
0827195731<rszeno> i have
0827195751<rszeno> few in fact
0827195859<sirdancealot> so..personal assistants with their shitty regexes...newshit can replace those
0827195903<sirdancealot> and this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=AutomateIt.mainPackage&hl=cs
0827195929<sirdancealot> and let people go deeper and create scripts and apps
0827195958<rszeno> is nothing semantic on google, just mess, :)
0827200140<rszeno> regex are usefull but usualy are missused, :)
0827200231<sirdancealot> misunderstood
0827200238<rszeno> is a type 3 chomsky grammar usualy
0827200304<rszeno> yes, all kind of misses, :)
0827200333<sirdancealot> i have some old attempts at a grammar for making regexes readable somewhere
0827200415<rszeno> is hard
0827200426<sirdancealot> hard?
0827200433<rszeno> yes
0827200537<rszeno> clustering terminals for example
0827200609<sirdancealot> whats that mean
0827200618<rszeno> it follow one of [a list of chars]
0827200710<rszeno> then a range, a char between two consecutive chars
0827200734<rszeno> so [ab-z] is what?
0827200739<sirdancealot> you dont parse regexes with a cfg?
0827200821<rszeno> sometimes, often is a 1 type
0827200842<rszeno> not cfg i mean
0827200910<sirdancealot> the regex specification?
0827200915<rszeno> type 1 and 0
0827200931<rszeno> yes regex specs
0827201009<rszeno> depend of what restrictions you impose
0827201019<rszeno> pcre is not cfg
0827201028<rszeno> for example
0827201222<rszeno> anyway a type 1 can be tarnsformed
0827201234<sirdancealot> you make everything sound like a problem..:)
0827201240<rszeno> also a type 0
0827201318<rszeno> well it is, that's life :)
0827201337<sirdancealot> the problems are wholly elsewhere..
0827201345<sirdancealot> do you like Cher?

0829113444<rszeno> sirdancealot, i'm trying to put togheter a software freelancers team. You are interested? No work available at this moment!
0829113533<rszeno> no idea how or even will be payed
0829113630<rszeno> missing a if will be payed in previous sentence
0829145306<sirdancealot> yep im in:)
0829145341<sirdancealot> but first, did you watch sausage party?:)
0829145442<rszeno> not yet, missing storage space
0829145523<rszeno> free space first then i'll see it,:)
0829145530<sirdancealot> ok
0829153547<rszeno> i searched on freenode channels with name containing 'lisp': 7 rooms, 1 definitivly is not lisp
0829153623<rszeno> 7 except the ones i used before
0829162110<rszeno> 5 are, 1 is undecided yet, :)
0829162156<sirdancealot> :)
0829162232<rszeno> #lispclub is undecided
0829162235<rszeno> :)
0829162342<rszeno> 4 members with me, here we are only 2, :) number is not an issue
0829162630<rszeno> a bot for finding channels on a server will be good. Hard to define what to find but where is easy: channal name, topic, eventualy logs
0829162752<sirdancealot> :)
0829163432<rszeno> warweasle, have a project called qix, is in a way what i do and what you do in the same place
0829163509<rszeno> except he doesn't realise how complex will be
0829163559<rszeno> see this if you need: https://github.com/BradWBeer/Qix
0829163758<rszeno> and this for general info: http://lisp-qix.blogspot.ro/, google shit '.ro' will be probably replaced
0829163905<rszeno> skip the shaders part
0829163938<sirdancealot> i know
0829164007<rszeno> i'm curios if he explored the gpu and gl part of shaders,:)
0829164035<sirdancealot> what other part is there?
0829164048<sirdancealot> i tried to talk to him at some point
0829164112<sirdancealot> “Create a Document Object Model similar to modern web browsers DOM API. The ability to work with 2D and 3D with the same tools and a single language should produce a powerful system for displaying, editing and sharing documents of any kind. “
0829164229<rszeno> it doesn't because you need to choose a system or to make to work will any
0829164301<rszeno> in the end is a 'in place code' to handle this
0829164359<rszeno> you need a reasoner for decisions, coding if's doesn't work, is too expensive
0829164518<rszeno> this is how software companies make money, :)
0829164543<rszeno> not the reasoner part,:)
0829164616<sirdancealot> i want to turn newshit into an android app
0829164721<sirdancealot> must put some more work into it, then create a demo
0829164727<rszeno> you can generate js from python, not high quality, usualy need manual bug fixes
0829164730<sirdancealot> then find some marketinghead :)
0829164735<sirdancealot> yea been there
0829164804<sirdancealot> there was nothing to handle a project as heavy as newshit
0829164808<sirdancealot> maybe pypy-js
0829164831<rszeno> marketing is not hard today
0829164833<sirdancealot> anyway i dont have a problem with a rewrite into another language, thats the least of work
0829164911<rszeno> see my linkedin connections for marketing, some of them
0829164922<sirdancealot> :)
0829164951<sirdancealot> well, first i have some contacts of my own
0829165004<rszeno> in last time my focus was on management, :)
0829165043<rszeno> just join linkedin and connect with me, i will help
0829165213<rszeno> but you need to spend some time daily to make you look 'interesting' for other fuure connections
0829165259<rszeno> just to read and click what you like
0829165441<sirdancealot> sounds self-destructive
0829165635<sirdancealot> i sent you a jaguar
0829165744<rszeno> good,:)
0829165907<rszeno> yes, sound self-distructive, from time to time it is, when is nothing interesting, but is somesort of fun usualy
0829171510<rszeno> where is the jaguar?
0829171633<sirdancealot> i sent you a message
0829172054<rszeno> you are Jindrich Kolman? on linkedin?
0829172135<rszeno> i have a message from him right now
0829172214<sirdancealot> yup
0829172237<rszeno> ok, :)
0829172358<rszeno> skill part from profile is missing, usualy this will trigger more connections
0829172434<sirdancealot> and you have past employers missing:)
0829172442<sirdancealot> cant "recommend" you
0829172459<rszeno> i have a lot of missing stuff,:)
0829172503<sirdancealot> ok time to go home
0829172517<rszeno> don't recommand me,:)
0829172554<sirdancealot> ttyl

0829204228<rszeno> btw if you have somebody who need some software, they do and you can take some money
0829204257<editable-koo>sounds nice:)
0829204332<rszeno> kind of, but this assume you do the contact with them
0829204434<rszeno> usualy only first contract is payed( i don't know, is my assumption)
0829204540<rszeno> anyway is a way to get some money. :)
0829204704<editable-koo>what do you mean first contract?
0829204711<rszeno> indian companies have high prices, a indian said this, i never work before with them

0829211050<rszeno> this led stuff and soldering on pcb
0829211111<editable-koo>these leds arent on a pcb, they just have two wires soldered onto them
0829211131<editable-koo>you can do it with gun solder..
0829211308<editable-koo>making a machine for doing it would be nice...
0829211414<rszeno> see alibaba.com
0829211424<editable-koo>im not sure i see any pre-wired leds there
0829211502<editable-koo>it says "pre-wired", but the pictures dont show it, and their supply ability would suggest they have a machine for it
          <rszeno> look for dong guang and leds
0829211543<editable-koo>nothing
0829211641<editable-koo>i need sleep, gn:)
0829211707<rszeno> ok, good, night,:)

0902232333<rszeno> just remember i read  it happend in Praha and somrthing about some polish. I'm usuly interested in what happen from a techical point of view
0902232742<rszeno> attacs are performed from zombies usuly
0902233852<editable-koo>maybe we will review the decision to not encrypt the SMS messages in our next system and to rely only on sender name whitelist.:)

0905013517<rszeno> yes but is only a wish at this moment
0905013613<stoopkid> well, i'd be up for that, i'm about to set up a portfolio site for myself so i can start doing some freelance web dev stuff anyway
0905013635<rszeno> i have a project, maybe, but no money for it
0905013713<stoopkid> what's the project
0905013724<rszeno> all i need are people who are thinking, :)
0905013747<rszeno> a reasorener and a kb behind
0905013837<stoopkid> what kind of reasoner/kb? i'm familiar with type theory systems and systems like prolog

0905015747<rszeno> administration is a difficult task, and also your and you need to know what is the state o the whole job at hand
0905015838<stoopkid> definitely
0905020012<rszeno> a foreman/superviser as a job was invented to solve this kind of stuff but is a kind of shame in doing this,:)
0905020024<stoopkid> a shame why?
0905020122<rszeno> nobody on linkedin is not of this kind,:)
0905020148<rszeno> all are super x or simple workers
0905020229<rszeno> to much modesty or proud, probably
0905020406<rszeno> some pople doesn't trust themself enough to say louder they can do something
0905020438<rszeno> other belive they can do but can't realy deliver
0905020536<rszeno> linkedin is a interesting place,:)
0905020904<stoopkid> sorry bad connection here
0905020922<stoopkid> well, people are strange like that
0905020953<rszeno> no problem with connection
0905021045<rszeno> yes, peoples are kind of strange but easy to understand
0905021243<rszeno> allmost everything depend of few attributes
0905021300<rszeno> age, gender and location
0905021359<rszeno> even missconceptions
0905021544<stoopkid> those things would never factor into my criteria if i were hiring for software dev work except *maybe* location, if the job really required it
0905021624<rszeno> maybe you can help me to understand what the story about Hillary is so important for americans
0905021728<rszeno> yes, location is factor but with 'working remote' is less important imo
0905021927<rszeno> is better to see somebody reactions when you say something but i don't know if si realy something which somebody can count
0905022047<rszeno> a good actor can play the cheater role, in the end what remain is trust and results
0905022054<stoopkid> which story with hillary? and yea for software dev working remote could be more efficient if there was a good process in place with good technical support for the remote communication process, and ofc it would often be a necessity like for example with you and i here
0905022145<rszeno> hillary: something with secret mails deleted
0905022151<stoopkid> oh that
0905022236<rszeno> how this can make her a good or bad president?
0905022412<rszeno> peoples lie often, mainly in a sensitive position when can lose something
0905022532<stoopkid> well, for one it just indicates corruption in the case that the deleted e-mails were actually hiding something, or at least indicates general negligence if they weren't, and i don't think these are things we should tolerate from any government officials let alone high-ranking ones like senator, secretary of state, or god forbid commander in chief of the
          <stoopkid> military
0905022642<rszeno> but a human make mistakes, nobody can stop this
0905022732<rszeno> btw, i'm for her, imo is better then Trump
0905022739<stoopkid> the question is whether or not it was a mistake, and my stance with government officials is that at the very least we shouldn't promote them until they can demonstrate their innocence
0905022826<rszeno> probably was at begining and end with doing on purpose the rest
0905022910<rszeno> imo is a experience which will never forget
0905023009<rszeno> all this noise and scandal will make her more carefull then somebody who didn't do it
0905023021<stoopkid> i agree she's better them Trump, because I think Trump would immediately shake everything up by removing the current executive officials and replacing them with conservatives and supporters of big money, and same with the supreme court judges some of which would probably be up for nomination especially if he landed a second term
0905023048<stoopkid> which would be all the more likely if he landed the first term
0905023220<rszeno> probably, i don't trust Trump because he does't seem to think
0905023248<stoopkid> when he talks he doesn't sound like he actually understands what the authority of the president even is
0905023319<stoopkid> and what disturbs me is that all of his supporters don't seem to understand it either
0905023325<rszeno> all what he say seems prety an impulse imposed by who is talking to
0905023406<rszeno> true, :)
0905023531<rszeno> i told two times on linkedin that Hillary is better and they simply attack me,:)
0905023611<stoopkid> what disturbs me most though is that the general american public thinks that the fact that the decision comes down to these two and that we basically have no choice but to pick one is somehow an acceptable situation
0905023658<rszeno> is same problem every where in the world, right now
0905023753<rszeno> USA should be happy that is not so bad like here,:)
0905023926<rszeno> nobody listen what you say and politicians care only if can make money for themself,:)
0905024026<rszeno> a blomberg world,:)
0905024103<stoopkid> true, doesn't mean we shouldn't still strive to do as best as possible here though, rather than tolerate a perhaps better but still generally inadequate system
0905024123<rszeno> sure,
0905024245<rszeno> what i hope is the next president of yours will care more about internal state of usa then of outside word.:)
0905024327<stoopkid> that'd probably be trump tbh
          <rszeno> this intermix is not good in general
0905024445<rszeno> so will be some war? I have the feeling this is more probable with Trump then with Hillary
0905024618<rszeno> is BREXIT and EU on one side
0905024702<rszeno> I don't trust Makrel in general
0905024830<rszeno> everything is looking like to the begining of 19xx
0905024918<stoopkid> trump talks big about amping up the fighting and annihilating terrorists and shit, but i don't think he's really that serious about that as much as he is on internal shit like cutting taxes on big business and the wealthy, switching up the executive branch to install more social conservatives, etc... it's hard for me to imagine that war is really something
          <stoopkid> he could be that serious about because he's never been involved with it before
0905025014<rszeno> Germany is hidind behing behind EU
0905025048<rszeno> an economic war is still a kind of war
0905025213<rszeno> peoples doesn't get anything good from this, just big words and povery
0905025235<stoopkid> idk that hillary wouldn't wage whatever kinds of economic war against other nations that trump would though
0905025304<rszeno> probably is no difference
0905025314<stoopkid> i think hillary might wage ever-so-slightly less of an economic war against at least US citizens though heh
0905025343<rszeno> on top they have other priorities
0905025414<rszeno> i mean being on top, president or whatever
0905025424<stoopkid> always, this is the fundamental flaw with highly verticalized society, especially when institutionalized by law
0905025503<rszeno> we don't have anything better,:)
0905025630<rszeno> if are two peoples somewhere one must be the boss, else everything is going down
0905025818<rszeno> colaboration is a hard task
0905030042<stoopkid> i disagree that there need be anything such as "bosses", per se. main function of a "boss" is as a central point for the others to coordinate around, like the wheel around an axis, the problem is when people confuse the central focal point as being "above them"
0905030112<rszeno> what is your favorite prog. lang?
0905030205<stoopkid> probably agda
0905030223<rszeno> yes, being boss require others skills
0905030306<rszeno> so haskell?
0905030311<stoopkid> indeed, administration is no easy task, and a lot of coders hate doing it
0905030331<stoopkid> haskell works too, to some extent
0905030432<stoopkid> my reasons for picking this as a favorite though aren't anything to do with my ability to roll out fully-featured software in it efficiently, they're just well designed with a solid theoretical foundations and a lot of cool capabilities with the type system
0905030511<rszeno> i had hoping something more basic/primitive like c or..,:)
0905030542<rszeno> sirdancealot?
0905030544<stoopkid> c/c++, python, or something like that is what i'd use for a real project
0905030613<stoopkid> (unless that project really called for the sophistication of something like agda)
0905030631<rszeno> so c is good? not c++ or c11 or a like?
0905030705<stoopkid> c works, i just learn whatever lang everyone wants to use
0905030732<stoopkid> (err, i already know c though, mostly)
0905030737<rszeno> is like a game engine, you must first define a new language for work
0905030814<sirdancealot> i prefer lemon lang
0905030845<stoopkid> any time i've had a job as a software dev it was never using a language i used at any of the previous jobs, so, they all just kind of look the same to me at this point
0905030902<rszeno> you can write a parser/crosscompler to c from lemon?
0905030923<sirdancealot> i could
0905031053<rszeno> good, then will end with c with our own framework each
0905031103<sirdancealot> lol
0905031220<rszeno> finding a source of money is first priority now
0905031240<rszeno> we must live in a way,:)
0905031346<stoopkid> i agree. got any plans wrt how to go about that?
0905031350<rszeno> try to think if we can use freelance and an automated process for this
0905031414<sirdancealot> what do you mean use freelance rszeno?
0905031449<rszeno> geting projects for money and reusing code to fullfill it
0905031529<rszeno> being a team is more powerfull then alone
0905031614<stoopkid> there's things we could automate there which would be useful. what i doubt though is that the effort to design and implement the automation would be cost-effective with our time until after we had a revenue stream to allow us some flexibility
0905031634<rszeno> also complicate, we must be all in sync someway
0905031729<rszeno> optimisation can be automated to some extent
0905031856<rszeno> i'm thinking to having a intermediate lang to describe what is done and why
0905031931<sirdancealot> wait wait what are we talking about now?
0905031932<rszeno> it will end with a repository of some sort
0905031939<stoopkid> lemon's lang is evolving into something that could be suitable for that
0905031955<rszeno> is ok
0905032146<rszeno> can you put it in a tech spec? we need for lerning lemon at first step also translation, etc..
0905032216<sirdancealot> tech spec?:)
0905032238<rszeno> a grammar and element desctription
0905032301<rszeno> a formalism is good too,:)
0905032336<sirdancealot> maybe i can finish some features and write a spec if i know for what purpose
0905032344<rszeno> should be plural, elements
0905032413<rszeno> writing arbitrary c code
0905032428<rszeno> purpose,^^^
0905032440<sirdancealot> ah hmmmm
0905032520<rszeno> pieces of c to do a given task
0905032550<sirdancealot> you want to parse and represent c with lemon?
0905032555<rszeno> with context, os, libs
0905032657<rszeno> not realy, i guess i have a better framework for this, but is only a guess
0905032741<rszeno> will be good to parse c and output lemon,:)
0905032750<stoopkid> hrm, i like where you're going with this, but i think that at the stage we're at now introducing anything like this as a way to coordinate ourselves would take time/energy away from that first goal of finding a source of revenue, and we don't have any projects to indicate to us what is really important to automate and what should be left to done manually in
          <stoopkid> order to reach financial success with this as quickly as possible, at which point we would hypothetically have that necessary knowledge and some financial flexibility to actually experiment
0905032847<stoopkid> at this stage it's administrative overhead without anything to administrate
0905032925<sirdancealot> parse c and output lemon..
0905032952<stoopkid> hrm i read that backwards the first time
0905033000<rszeno> all my life i avoided to work in teams mainly because i love to control what i do and when
0905033021<stoopkid> understandable
0905033050<sirdancealot> rszeno, it could help if you had your code available for us to see ..
0905033055<stoopkid> and then you find that although you have total control when you do that, you have total control over very little?
0905033142<rszeno> sirdancelot, sure but is perl
0905033214<stoopkid> what's this code?
0905033226<rszeno> stoopkid, you never have control in fact,:)
0905033227<sirdancealot> doesnt matter what lang
0905033330<rszeno> a kind of framwork for grammars is called zamolxe
0905033353<sirdancealot> i can write a definition of c in lemon, for parsing i might just use some python lib, would be simpler than buildin a c parser with my stuff
0905033530<rszeno> my idea is to have a perser generator, with zamolxe, in the reasoner
0905033613<rszeno> zamolxe was designed as being standalone
0905033652<rszeno> explaination:
0905033742<rszeno> you have a data source and language used by the source is unknown
0905033836<rszeno> all you must do is to describe the language, all the rest should be done automaticaly
0905033857<stoopkid> the rest of what
0905033908<sirdancealot> what kind of data, a c program?
0905033926<rszeno> whatever, communication, ...
0905033949<rszeno> let assume the data source is linkedin
0905034034<rszeno> what you want to do is not defined before you know the data source
0905034146<rszeno> when you know what you need is to collect information from linkedin and put in some place
0905034238<rszeno> when you decide you want for example "to grow number of your connection"
0905034350<rszeno> all you need is to describe the 'intention' and use the info you have to build a mechanism for that intention
0905034518<stoopkid> "all"
0905034527<sirdancealot> its a bit vague..
0905034550<stoopkid> that "all" seems to be describing pretty much the entirety of programming
0905034605<rszeno> yes, is vague and extensive
0905034654<rszeno> yes, include all programming stuff in fact,:)
0905034738<rszeno> both as category and details
0905034755<stoopkid> so, i assume the goal here is to make description of intention and building mechanisms for those intentions easier
0905034811<rszeno> distributed, concurrent
0905034832<rszeno> n3 for descriptions
0905034944<rszeno> all the logic and kb should be in n3, unfortulately i can't change this, is too late
0905035129<rszeno> logic doesn't matter as long you have a n3 model for it and a reasoner wich can process it without complaining about something
0905035204<stoopkid> hrm..
0905035316<sirdancealot> what cant you change?
0905035318<stoopkid> and what would the reasoner do? lang-to-lang translation?
0905035347<rszeno> having n3 for descriptions
0905035448<rszeno> unification only, proof by closure paths
0905035513<stoopkid> i'm not sure what the goal of the reasoning is though
0905035613<rszeno> in general or some specific case?
0905035652<rszeno> or simply "what is used for?"
0905035728<stoopkid> yea, we're putting everything into n3, but then what are we using that for
0905035929<rszeno> any intention is a local goal. Then we simply use the accumuated knowladge to rich the local goal
0905040101<rszeno> having all in n3 is just a decison, can be anything else but it mist fit the idea of "being good for description"
0905040154<stoopkid> hrm, i like the idea but it seems pretty far from market, unless you know something i don't wrt the market
0905040248<rszeno> is not for market is for you, me, parts of whatever we are,:)
0905040358<rszeno> the product of this can be for market, for example some generated code
0905040456<rszeno> can be used in a freelance contract for example
0905040519<stoopkid> hrm, so this would be a tool-set and common language for automating software dev tasks like code generation etc..?
0905040600<rszeno> yes, something like this
0905040637<rszeno> actualy a kind of system
0905040746<rszeno> one example: you can have a contract for security or administration
0905040901<rszeno> and the system will do the work because have the knowladge and the mechanism, the reasoner
0905041005<rszeno> the dificult part is to acumulate and clean the descriptions
0905041100<rszeno> need humans having domain knowladge
0905041126<rszeno> kind of supervised learning
0905041248<stoopkid> this sounds like something to work on after we've got a revenue stream and projects demonstrating to us specific things to automate, as otherwise we'd be working on it with no revenue stream, without any specific goal, and without the help of this software we'd be building. it's more of a long-term investment kind of thing
0905041346<rszeno> yes, is long term, i do this from '70,:)
0905041625<rszeno> it take me a lot  of time to realise that is nothing specific in AI, you have a goal only when you have a specific project
0905041739<rszeno> is all about methods of doing things not about things you do
0905041924<rszeno> the thing we do must encode this methods only
0905041946<rszeno> and use them rarely
0905042216<rszeno> for example trail and error: just choose something decent and see results
0905042451<stoopkid> hrm, i don't see any of this leading to a revenue stream though except for in the long term if we actually invested the time/energy to design & build something like this up to the point that it actually makes dev more efficient rather than just siphoning time/energy away from working directly on projects
0905042503<rszeno> takeing decison is a logic process but the task also involve classification and a lot of previous knowledge and decisopns
0905042640<rszeno> time is a powerfull resource, if you can have it for other goals them rutine
0905042821<stoopkid> unfortunately at this point my only goal can be to get directly to a source of money as quickly as possible, and leave everything else to be worked on afterwards
0905042845<rszeno> freelance
0905042901<rszeno> it saved me few times
0905042934<rszeno> try freelance.org
0905042939<stoopkid> yea that's my best bet to keep me afloat until i can get a full-time job that can make ends meet
0905043016<rszeno> you don't need a full job,:)
0905043046<stoopkid> well, w/e job that makes ends meet, if i can pay all my bills freelance i'd never do anything else
0905043210<rszeno> if you can use paypal i have $60 there, now
0905043601<sirdancealot> i dont think that solves stoopkid's life situation..:)
0905043711<rszeno> no but is a temporar solution
0905044329<sirdancealot> stoopkid, like we talked about, if you find some work for two, i can find time to put in
0905044408<rszeno> three, not only two,:)
0905044430<sirdancealot> good
0905044509<sirdancealot> ive lowered my standards lately...
0905044519<sirdancealot> im particularly curious about java
0905044538<sirdancealot> dunno how its in the US but here java and js are the best paying
0905044558<sirdancealot> apparently
0905044623<rszeno> i'm good with js not good with java,:)
0905044634<stoopkid> it's probably about the same in the US
0905044649<rszeno> mobile market need java
0905044740<rszeno> i have somebody on linkedin doing this
0905044805<rszeno> Bidhuna Babu, is indian
0905044825<stoopkid> i guess i should have some kind of existence in social media
0905044841<sirdancealot> at elektroline my next task is supposed to be a Qt app https://www.qt.io/mobile-app-development/
0905044844<rszeno> join linkedin
0905044916<sirdancealot> the plan is a desktop app and possibly later mobile
0905045011<rszeno> it look like they already do mobile
0905045519<stoopkid> alright i'm gonna start off getting myself set up on linkedin and facebook and all that and getting a website set up for us to market with, unless somebody's already got one they want to use?
0905045615<stoopkid> sirdancealot: i'd need to learn qt but i'd be down to work on that if there's enough work for two
0905045626<rszeno> we are both on likedin, i'm not on facebook
0905045646<rszeno> qt like gtk is a mess
0905045712<sirdancealot> website, what for?
0905045748<rszeno> https://www.qt.io/download/
0905045804<stoopkid> market for software dev work, particularly web dev
0905045832<rszeno> webgl, another mess
0905045921<rszeno> $79/month
0905045936<sirdancealot> stoopkid, i dont a website is needed or even desirable these days for chasing jobs
0905045941<sirdancealot> rszeno, for what?
0905050001<rszeno> qt.io said this
0905050025<sirdancealot> licensing?
0905050031<rszeno> i have no idea what for.
0905050044<rszeno> possible

0905050532<rszeno> Timisoara
0905050601<rszeno> i'm near, in a vilage, Giroc
0905050640<sirdancealot> rszeno, the question mark was for the gpl stuff, but ok:)
0905050704<rszeno> aha, :)
0905050734<stoopkid> sirdancealot: baltimore
0905050810<rszeno> gpl say something about preserving licence with propriteary transfer
0905050847<rszeno> is from what i recall but we could check
0905050940<sirdancealot> hm hm
0905050953<rszeno> doesn't matter untill we are involved somehow,:)
0905051015<stoopkid> the website isn't really for marketing myself on the angle of being a prospective employee to some employer, it's for the angle of marketing myself (or this team) as a service to prospective clients, which i think is a better angle for freelance especially for a team working internationally
0905051158<rszeno> wait, which website?
0905051207<sirdancealot> well, as you wish
0905051258<rszeno> w3c.org, :)
0905051355<stoopkid> just a site to describe my services and showcase work, nothing special
0905051449<rszeno> chose hosting, dns and just build a page on it
0905051542<stoopkid> yep
0905051546<rszeno> let me know the url to help with spreading it
0905051616<sirdancealot> stoopkid, as on the elektroline stuff, my contract is gonna be for $7.8/hour, but we can try
0905051626<rszeno> if you join linkedin put the link in profile
0905051728<rszeno> 7.8 or 7... 8?
0905051736<sirdancealot> point
0905051847<sirdancealot> or thats the pessimistic expectation
          <rszeno> ok, then first, i'm just curious how time you need to become rich,:)
0905051915<rszeno> is over $50 a day
0905051934<sirdancealot> its crap
0905051936<rszeno> 8 hours
0905051946<sirdancealot> they openly admit they are trying to screw me over
0905051953<rszeno> yes, is low but usual
0905052032<rszeno> almost everybody pay poor
0905052053<sirdancealot> all the good offers are js and java..
0905052111<rszeno> both are easy
0905052120<sirdancealot> yeah
0905052220<rszeno> well, java is a mess probably is something difficult in it
0905052333<rszeno> jean mark need a java or scala developer but i don't know if he pay
0905052400<rszeno> scala is beter then java anyway
0905052404<sirdancealot> he doesnt seem to talk lately:)
0905052450<rszeno> yes, he have some contracts, guvernamental or so, so is busy
0905052452<sirdancealot> scala would be worth learning too i suppose
0905052508<rszeno> is easy
0905052525<rszeno> i already use it
0905052557<rszeno> but it still have same roots,:)
0905052620<rszeno> all will end to oracle,:)
0905052631<rszeno> js, java, scala
0905052751<rszeno> scala had a good start but was messed by building library for it
0905052820<sirdancealot> those damn libraries mess everything up
0905052847<stoopkid> good offers for .NET at least here in the US
0905052859<sirdancealot> yeah
0905052903<stoopkid> i guess we're a heavily microsoft-oriented country
0905052917<sirdancealot> nah its here too
0905053009<rszeno> and here too
0905053057<rszeno> india, china, almost everywhere
0905053158<rszeno> when is not ms is android
0905053435<rszeno> .net work on linux i guess
0905053446<sirdancealot> ya
0905053450<rszeno> never tryed
0905053500<stoopkid> as far as database work i mostly see stuff for enterprise database software that i'm not familiar with, db2 and such
0905053548<rszeno> sqlite or perl?
0905053637<rszeno> db2 look like they use perl
0905053823<rszeno> linux there?
0905053938<rszeno> try fille, will tell you
0905053947<stoopkid> yea most jobs i've looked at were asking at least for comfortability with linux
0905054210<rszeno> is good, i didn't seen windows since 2000, befor
0905054330<sirdancealot> yeah
0905054645<stoopkid> wrt the marketable skills/experience that i've got along the lines of the stuff we've listed out here, it's mostly just LAMP + HTML/CSS/JS, decent capacity for design including graphic design for web (though i really need to refine and professionalize my skills there), some experience with Java but no comprehensive knowledge of it for sure, and that's about
0905054646<stoopkid> it, though i don't think i'd have much problem filling in the gaps with my Java knowledge, expanding my web-dev skills to android & IOS app-dev, and i'm ready & willing to start diving into anything that people are paying money for
0905054730<stoopkid> i've got plenty other dev skills, but i classify them as "far from market"
0905054826<stoopkid> like, i didn't see any job listings for agda, n3 or prolog :)
0905054837<stoopkid> or prog-lang design
0905054904<stoopkid> or math, at least not anything i've got the credentials for
0905054906<sirdancealot> it depends
0905054950<sirdancealot> i think if you go stalking specific companies, you might find a job more appropriate for your interests
0905054951<rszeno> this are high skills, very rare
0905055039<rszeno> quality asurance, six sigma
0905055040<stoopkid> true, wrt stalking companies
0905055128<sirdancealot> ya i should take my own advice here
0905055142<sirdancealot> whats six sigma?
0905055201<rszeno> a method in qa
0905055303<rszeno> in last years i worked in some weird fields like qa and security
0905055314<stoopkid> i'm definitely on the look-out for things more appealing to my interests & the skill-set i've been working to develop, but, that market is still tiny today, i need to hedge my bet there with something more standard like web/app dev
          <rszeno> managment
0905055408<rszeno> yes web/app will usualy work
0905055502<sirdancealot> https://www.jetbrains.com/company/jobs/
0905055537<rszeno> market is a little full of it but they stll need it because what you find are poor skilled
0905055621<stoopkid> pretty much every biz needs a website and now most of them are starting to want apps as well, and yea it's a market flooded with non-programmers because of the misconception that web-dev is somehow "easier programming"
0905055758<rszeno> is not and is hard because is multi-disciplinar
0905055829<rszeno> to many different things in a single place
0905055907<stoopkid> indeed, that's why i learned the full stack
0905055945<rszeno> jetbrain - only two with effective work
0905060010<sirdancealot> ?
0905060017<stoopkid> only two devs?
0905060019<rszeno> what the hell is a campus ambassador?
0905060032<sirdancealot> marketing
0905060037<rszeno> yes, the rest are managers
0905060049<sirdancealot> ah:)
0905060052<rszeno> kind off
0905060059<stoopkid> i see
0905060155<stoopkid> yea you don't necessarily need a lot of devs to get a lot done, koo and i blaze through things with our pair programming stuff when we have a clear picture of what we're doing
0905060216<rszeno> 'Campus Ambassadors are community leaders opening up this opportunity to their university peers."
0905060233<rszeno> why they need this?
0905060254<sirdancealot> because people that go to university are dumb
0905060302<stoopkid> :)
0905060330<rszeno> yes, it seems so
0905060339<sirdancealot> at least jetbrains doesnt push it from preschool like microsoft
0905060354<sirdancealot> *since
0905060405<rszeno> :)
0905060440<rszeno> to much energy on advertising
0905060519* stoopkid shrugs
0905060522<rszeno> "They share information about JetBrains tools and                                             demonstrate their benefits and advantages. Dozens of students at MFF already                                             use JetBrains tools, and others join every month."
0905060611<stoopkid> if you advertise something to the extent that people perceive it as "the option", then they'll buy it
0905060617<stoopkid> regardless of its quality
0905060657<rszeno> and throw when they can't use it,:)
0905060732<rszeno> in the end is a flow of money
0905060858<rszeno> that "critical thinking" is missing, imo
0905061000<rszeno> maybe is better, everybody will live in the end
0905061021<stoopkid> the thing is, a company focused on making money isn't focused on making quality software, they're focused on making profitable software for short-term returns so that they can use that money to go make even more money
0905061107<rszeno> yes, i know


0905061116<stoopkid> quality software might be what lasts, but the person making money doesn't care, cause they last too, they just end up changing what it is they're doing with their money
0905061531<stoopkid> consumers generally don't hold any individuals in a company accountable for bad software, so the company sticks around, changes hands, and people who made money move around doing different things with their money because consumers will still buy it because they aren't aware enough of the details of the industry to realize that these people moving around just
          <stoopkid> looking for short-term profits are what's the main cause of low-quality software, let alone to realize who they are
0905061621<stoopkid> so, since working purely for short-term profits at the expense of quality is tolerated, it's the standard, since that's the fastest way to getting into a position for even more short-term profits
0905061654* stoopkid shrugs
0905061723<stoopkid> that's what we're up against if we choose to operate in any alternative way
0905061729<rszeno> in the end money is what everybody need
0905061801<stoopkid> yep
0905061905<rszeno> i have somebody on linkedin who sell couses to live on mars
0905061925<rszeno> cources
0905061940<rszeno> lessons, kind of
0905062003<rszeno> he worked for nasa
0905062036<stoopkid> that'd probably useful to know how to survive on the highly possible future post-apocalyptic earth
          <rszeno> probably have no job now
0905062045<stoopkid> probably be*
0905062144<rszeno> yes but is a very small chance to learn this,:)

0905062405<rszeno> how i see this, is hard to find a job, sound like a apocliptic earh already
0905062523<rszeno> are a lot of linkedin
0905062544<rszeno> world wide
0905062623<stoopkid> there's plenty of work for skilled techies, and they're putting everybody else out of work :)
0905062729<rszeno> usualy jobs offers doesn't fit with work offers
0905062745<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
0905062755<stoopkid> ah
          <rszeno> the problem is in timing
0905062829<stoopkid> it's a world-wide social problem
0905062908<rszeno> they look for people but are busy, when they doesn't look are free
0905063014<rszeno> i'm on linkedin now, :)
0905063203<rszeno> is a mess, invention of web is a mess,:)
0905063230<rszeno> bad decison, bad implementation
0905063343<stoopkid> imo the problem is that the way the typical labor arrangement works today doesn't put most laborers in a position to know how to actually participate in the economy except with specific request and instruction from a company, because they have no understanding of the other side, and likewise companies, executives & managers are understanding laborers less
          <stoopkid> and less
0905063443<rszeno> yes, like always, communication is missing
0905063633<stoopkid> also, in the US, the media and society in general gears the labor class to not think about this stuff, and just think about their job when they're at the job, and think about nothing to do with work when they're not at the job and just have fun instead, which leaves little or no time/energy for critical assessment of one's socioeconomic situation
0905063833<rszeno> people will do whatever they need doesn't matter what media say
0905063944<stoopkid> this sort of paints a picture of why there's a communication breakdown though, neither side is even really thinking about each other and what the other side needs, they're just looking at what they can take from each other, and the labor class is just getting less and less skilled at participating in the economy controlled by the companies
0905064106<stoopkid> in the US for example, most people only see a very very small range of rigid options, created for them by companies
0905064149<rszeno> this is probably everywhere
0905064307<rszeno> nobody care what you know but what they need
0905064411<rszeno> i have a friend, if funny, is professor
0905064500<rszeno> he learn to programm CNC is a language used by Fanuc
0905064609<rszeno> the funny part is that nobody use the language but he learn his students to use it,:)
0905064732<rszeno> have no utility in the end, is probably some personal revange that he learn it
0905064755<stoopkid> sounds like the majority of math education today
0905064835<rszeno> well you still have chances to use math,:)
0905064853<stoopkid> true
0905064933<stoopkid> it's at least a 0.00001% chance of ever using it rather than just 0% chance
0905064952<rszeno> yes,:)
0905065034<rszeno> are some groups of math on linkedin, i'm member,:)
0905065259<stoopkid> so, wrt splitting up work, i think we'd probably want to split that up according to our skills/experience/interest/time
0905065352<rszeno> i'm very bad with graphics
0905065420<stoopkid> like graphic design & multi-media?
0905065442<rszeno> yes
0905065515<stoopkid> i'm alright with that stuff, on web at least, and i know koo's got some skills there as well
0905065537<rszeno> except multi-media can be about code to wrap video, i'v done this
0905065627<rszeno> perl, php, js, can count on this from me
0905065730<rszeno> actualy less php, last time i did was more then few years ago
0905065758<rszeno> but i was a kind of expert,:)
0905065900<rszeno> was not me saying this but a lot of peoples on javascript.com, forum
0905065944<stoopkid> php and js from me as well, i've got a bit of experience with perl but would need to refresh, it's been years since i've used it
0905070016<rszeno> kind of expert on js to but were few better then me, authors of books and many years of experience
0905070052<rszeno> yes, probably i need refresh too
0905070125<stoopkid> well i guess you're our js guy then :)
0905070210<rszeno> ok, jquery too but what i know is pretty old
0905070302<stoopkid> jquery's great, is it not under active development anymore?
0905070317<rszeno> i have no idea
0905070340<rszeno> i didn't watch it
0905070401<stoopkid> ah woops i misread that, i read it as "i know that it's pretty old"
0905070452<rszeno> well when i worked with it was at a low version,:)
0905070531<stoopkid> i've worked it not too long ago, it's still just as good as always
0905070539<stoopkid> worked with it*
0905070656<rszeno> i never worked with their UI, not for a client i mean, what i did was just to try it
0905070809<rszeno> i suppose i can learn any framework used today but i didn't have any motivation
0905070928<stoopkid> i pretty much always use it when i work on web, it smooths out all the ad-hocness and makes it easier to maintain a design that works in all browsers (though it's not a magic bullet)
0905071046<rszeno> was easy for me to build what i need with dom and js or php/perl
0905071238<rszeno> in general i always avoided frameworks. they look like new names for same task and full of exploits
0905071323<rszeno> probably jquery was the cleanest
0905071431<rszeno> i don't know what is new now on the market
0905071502<rszeno> i seen offer for angular js
0905071601<rszeno> now i'm reading about neutrino, a exploit kit
0905071636<rszeno> seems their target is Magento
0905071704<stoopkid> well, jquery can't do anything that dom and js can't do already, but it's a good clean lang design, like, all the places you would think "it should work like this", it usually does work like that, and imo it's at the logical next level of abstraction beyond js/dom, so i find it preferable to working directly at the basic dom manipulation commands which are
          <stoopkid> pretty ad-hoc and don't come with nearly the same kind of support for complex manipulations that jquery provides very cleanly

0905071739<stoopkid> idk what's new on the market, and jquery is the only js framework i'm really familiar with, but from what i've seen on job listings it's still a desired skill
0905071826<rszeno> was and is probably still good
0905071917<rszeno> btw, i don't have experience with node but is not hard
0905072028<rszeno> i'v done something for server side for me, actualy i was ported a js thing from geko
0905072045<rszeno> few scripts
0905072046<stoopkid> me neither really but i've looked at it and it just seems like the same old js in some server-side packaging, which i don't think i'd have a problem with

0905075007<stoopkid> and it's easier to do this marketing yourself as a freelancer/company/service rather than a potential employee, where the employer expects it to be a "do what i tell you" rather than a "what can you do for me" kind of relationship
0905075030<rszeno> i used to achive their goals only, not what they said thei want
0905075116<rszeno> "i want a php site". :)
0905075210<rszeno> is pretty wierd
0905075326<rszeno> 'i want to be on first page in google search" is closer
0905075417<stoopkid> yea, SEO's a huge market that i'm not familiar with
0905075439<rszeno> i am
0905075503<rszeno> was the main task there
0905075610<rszeno> is easy, not so hard as it seems
0905075822<rszeno> i brought thei site in first few links on first page
0905075840<stoopkid> are you good with security, networking and/or scalable systems? if so i think we'd have a pretty serious web dev team just between the 3 of us
0905075934<rszeno> yes, but hosting on linux only
0905080014<stoopkid> hrm, yea i'm pretty much a linux-only guy too, as far as skills/experience goes
0905080018<rszeno> i have no idea what a window server require for sec or network
0905080110<rszeno> we can llearn but this require time
0905080147<rszeno> so i said only what i can do now
0905080259<stoopkid> hrm i think all 3 of us are mostly linux-only at this point, cuts us out of the microsoft and apple markets for back-end work, which is a pretty major dent, and yea it'd take time to get familiar with that
0905080350<stoopkid> but, with the skillsets we have between us we could at least take on serious medium-largish web projects on linux
0905080450<rszeno> like being IT for somebody?:)
0905080545<stoopkid> whatever they're paying for
0905080616<rszeno> we probably can do admininstration too but is poor pay

0905081143<rszeno> anyway, usa market is better then EU
0905081255<stoopkid> the market on jobs.com in the US is almost entirely for defense contractors and major financial institutions
0905081338<stoopkid> freelance.com will probably be better on my conscience :)
0905081424<rszeno> probably, is about bringing money in the end
0905081512<rszeno> i have no idea where is freelance.org located
0905081531<rszeno> but doesn't mater
0905081854<stoopkid> yep. so, the big money comes from the governments, the big banks and the big companies, until you own a product that changes your role and brings the money in from consumers. that's why i spend most of my time these days stalking these institutions. as far as profits go, the way to make them is to watch in detail how these institutions are spending and
          <stoopkid> position oneself to be ready to take on that job when they're ready to drop that money

0905085638<stoopkid> linkedin didn't even know about idris/agda/coq
0905085653* stoopkid shrugs
0905085741<stoopkid> i should probably take that PLC stuff off and put arduino up there instead
0905090007<rszeno> no, don't bother with that they just push on + without caring too much what it is, is a skill there
0905090124<rszeno> i'm surprisely good with java but in fact i only fixed some code for jean mark once

0905092417<rszeno> was few frome there, Ogbuji was another one
0905092454<rszeno> i didn't heard nothing from him from a long time
0905092542<rszeno> two brothers, both in usa too
0905092658<rszeno> this was generated with virtuoso
0905092700<rszeno> http://id.myopenlink.net/dataspace/person/KingsleyUyiIdehen
0905092733<rszeno> is his product, a kind of editor/reasoner
0905092811<rszeno> well not a reasoner in my opinion but he say it is,:)
0905092950<rszeno> if we start to write what i have in mind he will be a competitor,:)
0905093011<stoopkid> heh, good to know
0905093046<rszeno> except the kb, virtuoso doesn't include a given kb
0905093117<rszeno> and i'm thining to a real reasoner
0905093202<rszeno> what he do now is a kind of search ( virtuso )
0905093223<rszeno> anyway is a good tool
0905093408<stoopkid> will be a while before we'd have your tool though, not to mention profits from it, even if we got started on it immediately, but i'm down to work on long-term investments like that
0905093530<stoopkid> but, in the meantime i'd have to work it around the main thing i need to focus on which is short-term returns
0905093602<rszeno> probably will take time to finish it
0905093759<rszeno> is not a problem
0905093837<rszeno> i cook this from 40 years already
0905093920<rszeno> is huge anyway
0905094004<rszeno> probably we will never seen this finished
0905094046<rszeno> except if will work for us.:)
0905094140<rszeno> i mean the tool will  work toghether with us,:)
0905094213<stoopkid> best to just work incrementally imo, trial and error like you said, preferably based on specific dev problems resulting from real projects that could be solved by automation
0905094243<rszeno> yes
0905094327<rszeno> but is a huge step anyway
0905094415<rszeno> all this years i just learn what i need
0905094537<rszeno> who know if all toghther will work
0905094805<stoopkid> so how familiar are you with type theory frameworks like idris/agda/coq?
0905094940<rszeno> prety wll with type theory
0905095013<rszeno> almost nine with the rest
0905095029<rszeno> none, i mean
0905095105<rszeno> coq a little
0905095125<stoopkid> idris, agda and coq are really just computer implementations of dependent type theory
0905095146<stoopkid> this is the way to go as far as provers and formal specifications go, imo
0905095244<rszeno> i have idris and agda installed, is not what i expect
0905095311<rszeno> i have hol and coq instaled too
0905095335<rszeno> closer to what i think is metamath
0905095420<rszeno> is pretty primitive but is more clear
0905095443<stoopkid> i haven't tried hol, but idris and agda are basically just like haskell extended with dependent types, and coq is also just haskell with dependent types but it's harder to tell because they use a tactics language for their proofs/programs rather than direct lambda-calculus expressions in haskell syntax like idris and agda do
0905095556<stoopkid> haskell + dependent types basically makes a theorem and proof framework for constructive higher-order predicate logic
0905095635<stoopkid> coq is entirely oriented as a proof framework, agda and idris on the other hand are geared more as programming languages, like haskell
0905095640<rszeno> dpendent types are complex in the end typing is a nightmair
0905095702<stoopkid> dependent types aren't any more complex than "forall" and "there exists"
0905095743<rszeno> hol can work with omega from lambda cube
0905095815<stoopkid> what do you mean work with?
0905095909<rszeno> the formalism once you chose it must be used someway
0905095924<rszeno> hol can do this
0905095957<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
0905100026<rszeno> proofs, deductions, all the stuff you need
0905100121<rszeno> and preserve truth when it work, aka avoid logical traps
0905100223<rszeno> https://cakeml.org/
0905100226<stoopkid> i'm looking over it now, just looks like some flavor of dependently typed lambda calculus to me
0905100252<rszeno> take a look to cakeml
0905100302* stoopkid checking it out
0905100324<rszeno> is a interesting work
0905100357<rszeno> proofs for coq and hol written in cakeml
0905100446<rszeno> actualy i like acl2 but ...
0905100640<rszeno> magnus myreen is behind milawa
0905100734<stoopkid> the nice thing about dependent type theory frameworks is that they integrate the ability to express arbitrarily sophisticated mathematical objects within the framework of a programming language. if i want to express a type of mathematical groups, or rings, or fields, then in dependent type theory i just write out the axioms of these structures in a type, and
          <stoopkid> it's done
0905100805<stoopkid> in C++ or other lesser languages it's hard for me to imagine what kind of hoops you'd have to jump through to get that kind of functionality cleanly
0905100821<stoopkid> i'd probably just use the C++ to write a dependent type theory framework... :)
0905100848<rszeno> why i should choose dependent types when i can chose anything in the cube? :)
0905100943<stoopkid> well, i don't suggest to *only* use dependent types, there's a whole cube of dependencies to work with, dependent types included
0905101017<rszeno> yes, this is the cube in the end,:)
0905101109<rszeno> depending on problem you can chose what is simple and clar, :)
0905101202<rszeno> actualy i'm not sure if something given have any chance to work
0905101326<rszeno> solving, how can be solved, depend of problem in the end
0905101436<rszeno> anyway the theory is too abstract in the end
0905101443<stoopkid> type theory?
0905101458<rszeno> no, lambda cube
0905101529<rszeno> there is the computational key in the end
0905101604<rszeno> depend types is only a part of the problem
0905101624<stoopkid> hrm, i don't find it to be too abstract
0905101712<rszeno> depend of who are talking
0905101737<rszeno> is too complex for most programmers
0905101744<stoopkid> i agree that most people probably find it too abstract but that doesn't have much to do with building a good reasoner :)
0905101848<rszeno> is hard to make something practical from it
0905101915<rszeno> anyway the reasoner is probably simple
0905101928<rszeno> is just a unifier
0905101944<stoopkid> maybe the way i'd explain it: i see full-cube systems as being essentially mathematical assembly language
0905102031<stoopkid> they give full correspondence to predicate logic, but no mathematicians actually work directly in predicate logic, that's assembly language that they've built higher-level languages over
0905102153<stoopkid> this is why i'm really interested in these frameworks but at the same time don't have much illusions about their current marketability
0905102307<rszeno> is probably a little more complex because each part of the cube explore what you can do when you have an atribute
0905102340<stoopkid> sure, i mostly just restrict my focus to systems like agda/idris/coq where all 3 attributes are in play
0905102408<stoopkid> i.e. the opposite corner from the simply typed lambda calc
0905102424<rszeno> http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/cl/cl017.htm
0905102429<stoopkid> calculus of (inductive) constructions
0905102444<rszeno> probably the best description
0905102511<stoopkid> heh that was one of my main references when i was learning about it (is in the topic in #zennet)
0905102529<stoopkid> yea he gives a very straight-forward explanation

0905102616<stoopkid> why's that?
0905102625<rszeno> ski?

0905103241<rszeno> it is but the problem is what you can chew in the end

0905103647<stoopkid> alright i guess since you've got familiarity with this stuff and the demonstrated experience with reasoner systems, then i can include work involving type theory systems in my search as well (not that i'm expecting to find much)
0905103719<rszeno> yes,
0905103754<rszeno> my intention is to build a kind of framework
0905103929<rszeno> i don't see why can be used with dependent types and in general with any uninvented yet theory in general

0905192248<stoopkid> editable-koo: yo
0905194337<stoopkid> alright wrt splitting up work, i'm gonna focus on web/app dev, payment gateway interface, financing, accounting, marketing and market research
0905201551<editable-koo>hehe
0905201747<editable-koo>had a shitty day at work
0905201825<editable-koo>boss wanted me to "fix" something while i kept maintaining it would complicate things
0905201915<editable-koo>long story short i still have to fix everything up now
0905201959<editable-koo>but thats supposedly the end of the task
0905202116<editable-koo>so, jul 28 first day at the job
0905202138<editable-koo>sep 6 done
0905202153<editable-koo>30 or maaaaaybe 35 kczk
0905202323<editable-koo>so, lets say thats 25k/month
0905202413<editable-koo>and now their offer is 30k/month for full time, 36k after 3 months
0905202420<stoopkid> whats that in $?
0905202425<editable-koo>no czk
0905202442<stoopkid> no i mean how much would that be in $
0905202446<editable-koo>ah
0905202452<editable-koo>/24
0905202527<editable-koo>$1000/month
0905202612<editable-koo>but the confusing part is..
0905202701<editable-koo>he says its up to me to decide if i want a half-time or 3/4 time or whatever contract
0905202743<editable-koo>and im like, i dunno, ive definitely not been working full time this month, maybe a 3/4
0905202830<editable-koo>and he's like...no reaction
0905202904<editable-koo>and im like...scratch head, can we sign this as a full-time and ill keep working like this?
0905202929<editable-koo>is he trying to see how much work he can squeeze from me?
0905202953<stoopkid> yes & yes
0905203010<stoopkid> well, the first yes if he'd accept that
0905203045<editable-koo>another factor is my disability pension, it might be good for me to not go for more than half-time employment oficially
0905203106<editable-koo>yea well hmm
0905203132<stoopkid> you said that was around $600/mo or so?
0905203300<editable-koo>the new offer is 30(36)/mo so a half would be 15(18)
0905203403<stoopkid> so your disability pension is already covering around half the pay you'd get if you were working full-time anyway, so yea, might as well just stick to half-time if it would affect your pension
0905203500<stoopkid> maybe if that was like 60/mo it would be worth it, but, i don't see any gain in working full-time just to get the same income you would at half-time
0905203506<editable-koo>the pension is 9500czk/mo now, if i work half-time they'll eventually cut it down to 5kczk/mo
0905203528<stoopkid> hrm
0905203544<editable-koo>and if i work full time theyll cut it completely, unless i dress this as contract work
0905203645<editable-koo>and adjust the hours
0905203705<editable-koo>as i see folks around me doing
0905203830<stoopkid> would your boss go for that?
0905203910<editable-koo>he didnt seem happy about that idea
0905203933<stoopkid> did he say why?
0905204021<editable-koo>said i kept pushing them into a corner, he didnt get a chance to answer why and we didnt go back to it
0905204120* stoopkid shrugs
0905204127<editable-koo>im thinking maybe we could keep the current arrangement, which is a kind of contract work with some hour limit
0905204140<editable-koo>i have no idea tho
0905204213<editable-koo>im just trying to make a fair deal with them, but im totally confused
0905204214<stoopkid> if it's a kind of contract work maybe it wouldn't affect your disability pension? or have you checked into that
0905204258<editable-koo>yeah the contract work as ive been doing it now is easy to write the hours low and the rate high
0905204421<editable-koo>i told him id rather keep working task-based, and he was like uuuh thats dificult i dont even know if we can do that
0905204442<editable-koo>he wants me to sit there
0905204448<editable-koo>but he doesnt say how long
0905204532<stoopkid> is this on-site work or are you doing it from home?
0905204536<editable-koo>and says nobody will count hours
0905204553<editable-koo>its both, more on-site
0905204727<editable-koo>i suppose if my next task is again a separate project from their main line of work, i can keep working partly from home
0905204801<editable-koo>might be even less need for communication than on the testing framework
0905205056<stoopkid> hrm, probably just have to be patient with them wrt settling down on an employment arrangment that works for everybody, my experience is that most employers are pretty reasonable but only after you've really convinced them it's worth it to even bother thinking about it rather than just continuing with the current arrangements
0905205534<stoopkid> like, there's really only two reasons i can see that they wouldn't go for it, either they can pay you less under the current arrangements or it'd just be more legal & administrative overhead than they feel like dealing with
0905205602<stoopkid> (to switch up the arrangements, that is)
0905205808<editable-koo>i guess im gonna have to talk about it with someone else there than the "boss"
0905205826<editable-koo>i call him the boss but he's just a senior dev or something
0905205831<editable-koo>http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Czech+Republic&country2=United+States&city1=Prague&city2=Baltimore%2C+MD&tracking=getDispatchComparison
0905210005<stoopkid> so on average things cost about twice as much and people earn a bit less than twice as much, if i'm reading this chart right
0905210046<editable-koo>i cant find the earning side of things
0905210209<editable-koo>ah average salary
0905210212<stoopkid> hrm actually salaries are over 3 times as high
0905210250<stoopkid> i was looking at purchasing power, i guess that's a ratio of salary to average cost of goods
0905210500<stoopkid> yea, that is what that is
0905210513<editable-koo>at any case it doesnt seem to make sense that i'd split my local work with you
0905210521<stoopkid> ah
0905210535<stoopkid> yea wouldn't make much sense
0905210549<stoopkid> should be the other way around if anything
0905210555<editable-koo>yea
0905210659<editable-koo>probably best if you acted as a company or something there
0905210830<stoopkid> yea that would make sense, i guess i should start studying up on what's required to start an LLC
0905210855<editable-koo>hehe
0905212339<stoopkid> ok yea i'm just gonna start by getting that website set up and my friend's gonna help me set up an LLC
0905212618<stoopkid> and he's a real-estate agent who needs a portfolio site, said he's gonna pay me to set one up at some point and i'm having him stay on the look-out for projects for me since he's always networking
0905212755<stoopkid> there's some other people i'm gonna talk to about that as well, none of them are software devs but i think they could probably find us a decent amount of work if we cut them in with finders fees
0905212921<stoopkid> if anyone was gonna focus on recruiting i think that'd be rszeno
0905213315<stoopkid> there's really only a couple other specialties we'd need to fully round off our team here though, so, i'm not worried too much about recruiting
0905213404<editable-koo>you mean recruiting more work force?
0905213411<stoopkid> right
0905213453<editable-koo>maybe some of your #collaborate contacts?
0905213605<stoopkid> true, i know at least a few of them were willing to work for free on a pretty sophisticated project
0905213634<stoopkid> but, i haven't talked to most of them in a while, i think their interest fizzled out
0905213705<stoopkid> maybe the prospect of payment would rekindle that interest though
0905214047<stoopkid> i'll bring it up to them later when i can formulate my thoughts a bit better
0905214258<stoopkid> alright i guess if i'm gonna be doing web-dev i should start collecting reference web-sites and making feature check-lists
0905214527<editable-koo>feature check-lists?:)
0905214711<stoopkid> yea, lists of every feature you'd expect to see on a web-site so that i can prepare and make sure i can efficiently incorporate any of these into a web-site design on demand
0905214841<editable-koo>alright
0905215003<stoopkid> i'd probably do the same for any kind of system where there's a set of standard features, but i've been meaning to do it for web for years and never really made it too far with it due to finding other work and stopping
0905215100<stoopkid> and i wish i had done it years ago cause the standard feature-set for web hasn't changed much at all
0905215147<stoopkid> maybe a greater degree of social media and app integration, but, just more not different
0905215404<stoopkid> yea i'm kind of anally formulaic, i admit this.. but, it works for me. i struggled with RDFS for months until i made a check-list and then we handled the whole thing minus a couple details in just a couple days after that
0905215722<stoopkid> anyway, the main big thing for contract software work that actually pays well is gonna be biz/finance software. ERP, CRM, payment gateway interface, database analysis which will often be market analysis, etc...
0905215839<editable-koo>sounds fun
0905215846<stoopkid> there's other big things, but, this one is especially permanent and universal
0905215848<editable-koo>what kind of checklist did you make for rdfs?
0905215937<stoopkid> every single detail that had to be implemented
0905220039<stoopkid> which was mostly just listing out every single pred or keyword and writing out a description for it in a document that was easier to work with than the actual specs
0905220116<stoopkid> (particularly a document where i had the ability to color-code everything according to its state of completion, or provide other indicators of the state of everything)
0905220142<stoopkid> i think you saw that document, i remember you commenting on the color-coding
0905220327<stoopkid> anyway, after i made the check-list, i had the assurance that there was nothing to look into besides what was on that check-list, and any time i was wondering what to do next, i just picked something colored as incomplete and worked a bit more on it, and within a couple days we had just about the whole document colored as complete
0905220434<stoopkid> check-list works every time, as long as it's actually an important check-list that you're dedicated to maintaining and completing
0905221118<stoopkid> a bit later down the road i've got a vague idea to combine git, editable-log and lemon into a system to keep track of everything done on a project

0905232741<stoopkid> nope, haven't checked it out at all
0905232831<rszeno> jmv need a scala developer
0905232911<stoopkid> what's he working on?
0905232944<rszeno> eulergui
0905233031<rszeno> he is the owner and developer
0905233200<rszeno> this irc channel belong to him,:)
0905233225<stoopkid> nice, that would be cool to work on, i guess i should learn scala and maybe down the road he'll be looking for somebody again
0905233326<rszeno> i doubt, he want people who care
0905233424<stoopkid> doubt he'll be looking for devs again?
0905233443<rszeno> yes
0905233620<rszeno> even now is not very enthusiast,:)
0905233713<stoopkid> hrm, i guess that doesn't make me very enthusiastic then either :)
0905233839<rszeno> maybe but you need to check what is doing first,:)
0905233904<rszeno> is intersting
0905233938<stoopkid> well i saw he popped in earlier, maybe he can go over it with me at some point
0905234017<rszeno> he poped for you, i told him
0905234047<stoopkid> woops, guess i should've stayed awake
0905234102<stoopkid> (not that i had much say in the matter heh)
0905234130<rszeno> np, you could explain him
0905234258<rszeno> or you can simple don't say nothing.
0905234701<rszeno> work is important not accidents
0905234825<rszeno> future work not previous,:)
0905234954<rszeno> experience is kind of irrelevant, is a new field
0905235018<stoopkid> true
0905235153<rszeno> you probably need to know n3, i can help you with this
0905235223<stoopkid> i'm pretty good with n3, koo and i built an euler reasoner replica
0905235245<rszeno> good
0905235321<stoopkid> there's a couple details with it that i'm unsure of that i'd like to go over with you two at some point, not at the moment though
0905235326<rszeno> jmv use n3
0905235346<rszeno> np
0905235422<rszeno> just ask when you need
0905235435<stoopkid> so, how much are these kinds of systems being used in industry?
0905235541<rszeno> jmv have some contracts in france
0905235619<rszeno> euler is sponsored by agfa
0905235738<rszeno> are not very used but are usefull, can be at least
0905235842<stoopkid> yea it's still beyond most people, afaict
0905235923<rszeno> actualy doesn't matter if data is rdf,turtle or n3
0905235958<rszeno> are only file formats
0906000028<rszeno> syntax
0906000058<rszeno> n3 have in plus rules
0906000219<rszeno> eulergui work with xml too
0906000316<rszeno> json-ld is closer to n3
0906000457<rszeno> i don't like json-ld,:)
0906000541<stoopkid> i haven't checked it out much yet
0906000605<rszeno> is good
0906000737<rszeno> i need a parse for it but was changed too often imo
0906000939<rszeno> i like stabile things even if are not so good
0906001023<rszeno> and things with less changes
0906001154<stoopkid> that's why i like logic programming and type-theory based languages, they've got fully designed logical frameworks based on natural logical principles, not much to be changed
0906001206<stoopkid> one of the reasons i like them*
0906001225<rszeno> is confusing to change something already deplayed somewher,:)
0906001335<rszeno> so, done something and use it only
0906001707<rszeno> probably i lose my patience
0906001803<stoopkid> well, understandably, why should the burden be on the user/customer to keep up with the changes
0906001819<rszeno> being old doesn't bring happyness,:)
0906001948<rszeno> probably i haven't too much patience when i was young too,:)
0906002143<rszeno> i remember i refused some clients just because they have contradictory requirements,:)
0906002154<stoopkid> i'm patient with people but i'm impatient when it comes to projects, i'm always anxious to keep things moving :)
0906002232<rszeno> i want  them done only
0906002329<stoopkid> you don't do it just for the love of coding? :)
0906002400<rszeno> no, coding is boring for me
0906002413<stoopkid> same, i've got no love/sentiment for it
0906002500<rszeno> is just coding, a necessary pain,:)
0906002616<rszeno> probably the reason i learn so much about computation was to avoid coding
0906002645<stoopkid> lol, yea makes sense
0906002745<rszeno> first reason for my friendship with jmv was generating code,:)
0906002849<rszeno> eulergui do some uniq things i never seen somewhere else
0906002934<rszeno> my only problem with him: is java,:)
0906003014<stoopkid> haha, understandable
0906003024<rszeno> probably i'm guilty for moving to scala



0906003059<rszeno> but doedn't make me too happy,:)
0906003105<stoopkid> i might as well learn java more in depth though considering all the money that gets thrown at it
0906003150<rszeno> yes, plus at this moment is the only posibility for mobile
0906003238<stoopkid> what do you mean?
0906003245<rszeno> is a huge market, bigger then was for pc
0906003335<stoopkid> i need to get some mobile devices
0906003336<rszeno> once you decide to do something for mobile java is the only option
0906003407<stoopkid> hrm, wasn't really aware of that
0906003453<stoopkid> i've played around with some ios dev on my friends' devices, not much but i don't remember having to use any java for it
0906003456<rszeno> is the only prog language accepted by mobile maker
0906003511<rszeno> simbian is dead
0906003555<rszeno> imo apple is another story
0906003559<stoopkid> i guess i need to look into this more
0906003616<rszeno> will end by being defeated
0906003821<rszeno> is hard to keep clients with hot stuff, will work a time but eat a lot of money and you are always in conflict with users wich use something else
0906003854<rszeno> so is just a matter of time
0906004046<rszeno> probably they repeat history, same happend with dos/windows but other hardware,:)
0906004253<rszeno> all the windows office was a replica of claris work
0906004426<rszeno> where is claris now? apple have siri probably a big avantage now but will not stay long
0906004617<rszeno> i don't have an iphone, is my fault, is too expensive here
0906004739<stoopkid> i don't have any mobile devices heh
0906004743<rszeno> as a software developer or designer i probably shoud have one
0906004839<stoopkid> same, i need to invest in some less mobile computing equipment first though
0906004847<rszeno> i have two smart phones and a lot of gadgets with bluetooth and wi-fi
0906004921<stoopkid> i have a flip-phone from like 2008 and some arduino stuff lol
0906004925<rszeno> one with android and one with simbian, a kind of
0906004958<rszeno> i hate android, is poor and buggy
0906005050<rszeno> plus my isp is a idiot full with problems
0906005313<rszeno> dns doesn't work on phone, custumer service are just some idiots who doesn't make any difference between a static and a dynamic ip
0906005418<rszeno> techincal stuff is good but you can't tell the about defectes, are isolated
0906005612<rszeno> so you simple can pass over the idiots from custumer service wich are decided to kill if is necessary to make you a happy customer,:)



0906005730<rszeno> over all doesn't help to much are polite but completly useless
0906005932<rszeno> some 'the' need to be 'them' in previus sentences,:)
0906010020<rszeno> like in "techincal stuff is good but you can't tell the about defectes, are isolated"
0906010039<rszeno> must be "techincal stuff is good but you can't tell them about defectes, are isolated"
0906010057<stoopkid> that's how i read it, didn't catch the typo
0906010156<rszeno> yes, we humans can do this, is a nightmair for a machine
0906010303<stoopkid> machines have no context
0906010307<rszeno> fixing typos and making clear entities
0906010317<rszeno> mine have
0906010333<stoopkid> heh, well you've got more sophisticated machines than i do
0906010337<stoopkid> well then*
0906010341<rszeno> the problem is disambiguation
0906010408<stoopkid> disambiguation is a matter of context
0906010522<rszeno> yes but not only, is also part of history, experience of listening and understanting
0906010559<stoopkid> that's most of what i mean by context
0906010627<rszeno> yes could be
0906010722<rszeno> i usualy use context to refere the local context
0906010804<rszeno> previous sentences in the disscution domain
0906010837<stoopkid> my terminology is totally informal here, i just mean the computer has to have some understanding of the world and the current situation in it in order to understand how to disambiguate
0906010901<stoopkid> i see things based on throwing as many statistical methods at the problem as possible... i don't think this the right track at all
0906011051<stoopkid> imo aside from pure sensory processing, it's a logical problem, and when it gets down to uncertainties, then we logically decide to use probabilistic reasoning, and that probabilistic reasoning is usually in a framework of logic that we engineer logically for the purpose of making the decision
0906011153<rszeno> fuzzy logic and multi-valued imo
0906011308<stoopkid> depends how fuzzy the domain of reasoning is, like when i see people throwing neural nets at a problem i'm like "ok but i don't foresee this thing learning math"
0906011344<rszeno> i use nn,:)
0906011516<stoopkid> don't get me wrong, nn's are great for what they're great for, i used a genetic algorithm to essentially automatically build a neural net for character recognition, and it worked amazingly well for the minimal amount of effort i put into it
0906011538<rszeno> actualy is a ugly hibrid of neural network, fuzzy logic, multi-value logic,:)
0906011554<stoopkid> but, the nn doesn't have any "understanding" of what's happening, it just kind of molds to a shape
0906011641<stoopkid> hybrid systems make sense to me
0906011718<stoopkid> actually hybrid systems are the only thing that make sense to me, if we were talking about general AI like a robot or something
0906011720<rszeno> none of them have any understanding, which is in author, who make it,:)
0906011823<rszeno> yes robots need nn else are just some toasters,:)
0906012040<rszeno> the mars man form linkedin told me some strange thing about conscience and psychology of robots
0906012203<stoopkid> my conclusion with people is that somehow our neural-net brains have the capacity for a universal and rigid logical framework like A -> (A -> B) -> B, but, now that we have this rigid & universal logical framework, we don't have to use a neural net to express it anymore, any type of computer could suffice and it's just a matter of how it interfaces with the
          <stoopkid> rest of the hybrid system where things are fuzzier
0906012228<stoopkid> i should probably say my hypothesis rather than my conclusion
          <rszeno> i would like to talk more with him, right now what he said doesn't make sense of me but who knows
0906012514<rszeno> Jeff Howard or Hawkins, the palm os inventor have a interesting  theory about brain and AI, you should read it
0906012549<rszeno> numeta is the company name
0906012644<stoopkid> reverse-engineering the neocortex eh?
0906012652<stoopkid> now they're on the right track
0906012721<rszeno> yes, is Hawkins
0906012822<rszeno> is a model but make sence
0906012840<stoopkid> i agree with everything i'm seeing on their site so far, i've had theories about the brain & AI that are along the same lines wrt the role of the neocortex
0906012945<rszeno> i avoided the brain in general
0906013001<stoopkid> it's a rabbit-hole
0906013035<stoopkid> thinking about thinking about thinking about...
0906013259<rszeno> yes plus the tempation to do as it is because it work,:)
0906013501<rszeno> actualy iften there is nothing logic in copying what you see in nature
0906013644<rszeno> to be 'inspired by' is good but require understanding or at least some similarity
0906013756<stoopkid> my general theory wrt the brain is that life basically started out with sensory input attached pretty much directly to a direct reaction, and over time these sensory units evolved into more sophisticated receivers attached to neural structures that had the capacity to sort of form a topological description of the sensory input they were receiving, and these
          <stoopkid> neural structures evolved into the CNS, the brain, where you see different components associated to the different sensory inputs and physical outputs in the cortex and cerebellum, and the central thalamus structure coordinating everything
0906013839<stoopkid> we get a topological structure of vision, a topological structure of sound, a topological structure of touch, taste, etc...
0906013849<stoopkid> then we get this frontal cortex
0906013910<stoopkid> a generalized topological reasoner, capable of reasoning over all of these
0906013928<stoopkid> and all of a sudden we're separated from the animals
0906014010<stoopkid> all of a sudden we can do math
0906014021<rszeno> yes same here, is about structure not values
0906014130<rszeno> peoples are not good with rigurous actions
0906014210<stoopkid> the neofrontal cortex is very young, evolutionarily, and it's what really gives us that capacity
0906014329<rszeno> yes, is like a map, every place on it is some history
0906014411<stoopkid> i don't base any of this off of any expertise in neurology or anything, i just know the basic structure of the brain and its components, when they evolved relative to each other, and the capabilities of different animals that have developed these components or not developed them
0906014502<rszeno> i don't know anything about brain,:)
0906014529<rszeno> well maybe some basic thing
0906014556<stoopkid> frontal cortex you get animals that can direct themselves according to logic. mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and such
0906014628<stoopkid> pre/neofrontal cortex you get humans that have fully abstractified logic
0906014642<stoopkid> math
0906014749<rszeno> Jeff point me to intentinality
0906014916<rszeno> is more important for me to detect how is working not how is done
0906014932<rszeno> i mean made
0906015209<rszeno> probably bulding machines like a brain will be possible but what is important is how the brain do what is doing, a model
0906015300<rszeno> similar with what was done with artifical neuron
0906015432<rszeno> all the rest are maybe important for medicine not IT

0906101853<editable-koo><stoopkid> a bit later down the road i've got a vague idea to combine git, editable-log and lemon into a system to keep track of everything done on a project
0906101856<editable-koo>tell me more
0906101924<editable-koo>im slowly starting to think of lemon as a serious data keeping solution
0906101940<editable-koo>once i add the new gui..
0906102008<editable-koo>ive started organizing my stuff around it
0906131212<stoopkid> hey
0906131239<stoopkid> gotta help a friend out with some stuff this morning but i'll go over the idea with you after we get done with that
0906132942<stoopkid> actually on second thought there's not much to go over, i don't have the idea worked out at all, i just have a vague idea that there could be a single point-of-access for everything related to a software project/team/business etc.. and that some combo of git, editable-log and lemon could be used for that
0906133133<stoopkid> like, we've got chat-logs, online references, documentation that we write, code, comments, etc..
0906133241<stoopkid> usually these things are just kind of scattered, and everybody participating just kind of remembers where to look for the different kinds of things they're looking for
0906133536<stoopkid> big & well-organized software dev companies like google and apple probably use some kind of sophisticated solutions to keep track of all their resources, but, i'm thinking of something much simpler, not an "enterprise solution" but an app that an individual or small team could use
0906133837<stoopkid> i don't see any reason why git couldn't be used for storing everything, so that's where git comes in, probably without needing to be changed at all
0906134629<kook_> its fine for storing
0906134642<kook_> not that fine for versioning triple kbs
0906134655<kook_> but..might not be that bad for a start
0906134721<kook_> a triplestore is the connecting idea
0906134732<kook_> maybe it can do its own versioning
0906134736<kook_> like the virtuoso thing
0906134808<kook_> what we store i imagine is gonna be some mix between "lemon" trees and more "basic" data
0906134828<kook_> hopefully virtuoso can store big files as well
0906134836<kook_> and that might be all
0906134904<kook_> then its a matter of migrating everything "into lemon"
0906134922<kook_> or into "more basic rdf"
0906135003<kook_> editable log....must die...and be recreated in lemon
0906135021<kook_> rszeno has irc-rdf gatewaying worked out i guess
0906135040<kook_> lemon will provide an editable projection/gui
0906135111<stoopkid> so you're thinking to have everything in a version-controlled triple-store?
0906135201<kook_> dunno if version-controlled triple-store or doing version-control as part of the data
0906135222<stoopkid> hrm, the latter seems like a good idea to me
0906135230<kook_> https://www.google.cz/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=rdf+version+control&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=FsrOV7_2EsKk8wecnK7wCA
0906135257<kook_> versioning on the rdf level is still low level
0906135313<kook_> just a bit above versioning on the serialization level
0906135448<kook_> shrug
0906135557<kook_> i imagine we'll want to keep our data as non-lemonish as possible, not a node representing a chat line, but a more widely adopted chat-line rdf class
0906135637<kook_> versioning can just mean saying "on friday, this document contained these lines:..."
0906135651<kook_> and thrown in the db

0908135215<stoopkid> alright now i just need to get myself set up with web-dev tools and then i'll be ready to start laying out a portfolio site
0908144659<stoopkid> usually i just use aptana and just edit the code directly, i feel like i should try to use a more sophisticated framework though
0908145149<stoopkid> i guess i should get myself set up with java and scala while i'm at it
0908145707<stoopkid> "Java allows you to play online games, chat with people around the world, calculate your mortgage interest, and view images in 3D, just to name a few."
0908145714<stoopkid> wow, it's almost like a programming language
0908145722<stoopkid> crazy
0908162144<stoopkid> "actually, working alone sucks, we will do this either together or not at all i think", woops meant to respond to this yesterday
0908162228<stoopkid> yea i agree i don't think i'd be up to handle this by myself, for various reasons including the fact that working alone does indeed suck

0908194726<stoopkid> yep
0908194735<stoopkid> euler the proof engine, not the dude :P
0908194835<stoopkid> this is just where koo started talking to rszeno about it
0908194843<discardedes> well... the dude is a man crush of mine, but beyond that, not too sure about the engine
0908194844<discardedes> :P
0908194858<stoopkid> the engine's fun, that's what we were making for tau
0908194904<stoopkid> Socrates a man.
0908194909<stoopkid> {?x a man} => {?x a mortal}
          <discardedes> ic
0908194912<stoopkid> that stuff
0908194915<discardedes> already familiar
0908194916<discardedes> :)
0908194924<discardedes> yeah... that stuff is awsome
0908194931<discardedes> sort of like learch engine query
0908194933<discardedes> in a way
0908194944<discardedes> *search engine
0908194952<discardedes> or thats how i thought about it many years ago anyway
0908195000<discardedes> but more like a search through .... rules
0908195023<discardedes> but its more than that
0908195027<discardedes> yeah... its awsome
0908195050<discardedes> good stuff.... alot to be gotten working on it for sure
0908195058<editable-koo>yo
0908195100<editable-koo>stoopkid: try?
0908195109<discardedes> hello editable-koo
0908195114<editable-koo>hi
0908195132<stoopkid> tmux?
0908195141<discardedes> im gonna run out in a bit
0908195154<discardedes> so... just a heads up, ill be gone
0908195216<discardedes> editable-koo: me and stoopkid talked about the work project
0908195223<discardedes> just a heads up
0908195242<discardedes> youre probably sitting on lemonparty under a certain username maybe?
0908195250<discardedes> maybe you can check it out
0908195251<discardedes> anyhoo
0908195255<discardedes> im off for now
0908195332<stoopkid> cya discardedes, we'll go over it more next time you're around
0908195345<discardedes> ok
0908195356<discardedes> ill have to take a next step, then well have something to talk about
0908195404<discardedes> maybe look into git as we talked about
0908195412<discardedes> actually seems like a great first step to doing this
0908195509<discardedes> so thats my plan, im going to study git again
0908195525<discardedes> and i want to get familiar with using the interface in a useful way
0908195538<discardedes> then we will have a bunch more to talk about
0908195559<stoopkid> yea should probably learn git, we'll surely be using it
0908195623<discardedes> ok... so thats the bottleneck to our next in depth discussion
0908195624<discardedes> :)
0908195730<discardedes> this is another thing about my workflow, i like to talk, plan, do, talk, plan, do...
0908195739<stoopkid> not a big bottleneck, you'd have no problem picking it up as we go along, but hey studying it in depth couldn't hurt, i should probably do the same myself
          <discardedes> we talked, i have a plan, now i have something to do, then we can talk
0908195741<discardedes> :)
0908195745<discardedes> i know
0908200031<editable-koo>heya
0908200038<editable-koo>yea discardedes ill try to catch up with the logs
0908200047<discardedes> cool
0908200058<editable-koo>i sit under about half the names in #lemonparty btw
0908200116<editable-koo>good luck with git

09/10 14:07:10<rszeno> did you talk with jmv?
09/10 14:07:30<stoopkid> only a bit
09/10 14:08:09<rszeno> about job?
09/10 14:09:01<stoopkid> nah we didn't really get a chance to go over it yet
09/10 14:09:31<stoopkid> my hours and his don't seem to overlap much heh
09/10 14:10:33<rszeno> yes, europe hours and you hours are different,:)
09/10 14:12:25<rszeno> is a smell of missing desire on both sides,:)
09/10 14:15:09<stoopkid> well, i'm mostly focused on getting web-dev gigs started at this point, so i haven't really been making a full effort to dive into the scala thing yet
09/10 14:15:14<rszeno> jmv worked a long time in america
09/10 14:15:49<rszeno> he told me about semantic forms
09/10 14:17:32<rszeno> he use scala for web-dev
09/10 14:18:22<rszeno> actualy is indirect, scala for n3, n3 for web-dev
09/10 14:19:22<rszeno> eulergui in the processing support
09/10 14:21:07<stoopkid> ah, i meant "basic"/"typical" web-dev, like wordpress
09/10 14:21:45<rszeno> wordpress is just a mess
09/10 14:22:34<stoopkid> that's true but people are still paying for it
09/10 14:22:45<rszeno> it doesn't follow w3c drafts, actualy it doesn't follow anything
09/10 14:23:20<rszeno> who care, peoples are paying a lot of shit,:)
09/10 14:23:38<stoopkid> the only thing i care about right now is what people are paying for
09/10 14:23:42<rszeno> is not a reason, imo
09/10 14:24:31<rszeno> think to their needs not what they pay because is not relevant
09/10 14:25:22<stoopkid> me understanding their needs and me making them understand their needs are unfortunately two very different things
09/10 14:26:22<rszeno> you don't need to make them understand their needs,:)

09/10 14:33:23<stoopkid> hrm, i agree that this is how it should be, but i've rarely employers to be that flexible, especially at the beginning & especially when they already think they have an idea for how they want to handle it

09/10 14:38:22<rszeno> and reject url to the actress,:)
09/10 14:38:26<stoopkid> now it thinks i speak french
09/10 14:38:33<stoopkid> and unfortunately i don't XD
09/10 14:39:08<rszeno> what can i say, is google,:)
09/10 14:40:01<rszeno> actualy i understand french, doesn't bother me,:)
09/10 14:40:42<stoopkid> i had 10 years of french class during K-12, it apparently didn't work at all :)
09/10 14:41:03<editable-koo>and im financially kind of secured, still in a process with elektroline, and also want to work on newshit
09/10 14:41:14<editable-koo>10 years...must have been shitty teacher

09/10 14:42:18<rszeno> i have only few hours and was a beautifull teacher
09/10 14:42:43<editable-koo>:)
09/10 14:44:51<stoopkid> the curriculum was just totally incoherent, they'd basically repeat what they taught us in 1st grade every year, try a bit to move beyond that, and then the school year would end and we'd do it all over again
09/10 14:45:30<stoopkid> so i speak french at like a mentally challenged 1st grade level :)
09/10 14:46:24<rszeno> i don't speak, missing vocabulary
09/10 14:47:17<rszeno> but i can undestand, same with italian
09/10 14:48:01<rszeno> romanian are closer to both
09/10 14:49:31<editable-koo>like how i can understand a lot of russian and polish
09/10 14:49:40<rszeno> starting from 1800 in romania we had a lot of peoples who used french  words
09/10 14:50:04<rszeno> russian is hard for me
09/10 14:51:19<stoopkid> ne gavaryu ochen xorosho po ruskiy
09/10 14:51:26<rszeno> i try to understand, but usualy fail, bulgarian and ex-yougoslavians
09/10 14:51:36<editable-koo>:)
09/10 14:51:45<rszeno> i don't,:)
09/10 14:53:45<rszeno> i love to understand a lot of languages but...,:)
09/10 14:54:12<rszeno> korean,chinese,tamil,hindu,...
09/10 14:54:43<rszeno> also some lang from africa too
09/10 14:55:23<stoopkid> i used to spend a lot of time learning languages until the 1000th person asked me "but why? you already know english"
09/10 14:55:57<rszeno> is good to know,:)
09/10 14:57:00<rszeno> english is kind of universal but some parts are lost in translations
09/10 14:58:29<rszeno> in fact the culture is also lost,:)
09/10 14:59:20<rszeno> korean is a good example
09/10 15:02:49<rszeno> some thing look like a nonsense when are translated and are out of their historical context
09/10 15:03:40<rszeno> probably is same thing for many languages not only korean
09/10 15:04:09<editable-koo> the problem with english is the lack of variety of swear words
09/10 15:05:13<rszeno> is not only english,:)
09/10 15:05:39<rszeno> this is one i admire: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Ji-sub
09/10 15:06:00<rszeno> is very creative
09/10 15:16:37<rszeno> editable-koo, just swear in romanian, are planty of words,:)
09/10 15:17:42<rszeno> sometimes i bet even translation to english make you swear,:)
09/10 15:18:40<rszeno> in what language doesn't matter,:)
09/10 15:19:10<stoopkid> alright i've seen enough wordpress at this point, i'd be able to set up a simple page for somebody really quickly, time to get the rest of my web-dev environment set up
09/10 15:19:46<rszeno> not for me, so is not anybody,:)
09/10 15:21:31<rszeno> i used wordpress for a client, it just keep you busy without any need, is just a mess
09/10 15:22:42<stoopkid> busy with what
09/10 15:22:50<rszeno> there is a wordlift somewhere seems it help with setup but i never use it

09/10 15:26:31<jmv_> wordlift ? whatzat ?
09/10 15:26:54<stoopkid> hi jmv_
09/10 15:27:00<stoopkid> some wordpress plug-in apparently
09/10 15:27:22<jmv_> ha
09/10 15:27:26<stoopkid> i'm having trouble visualizing a gig where i'm using both wordpress and AI :)
09/10 15:28:22<jmv_> a gig ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_(music) ?
09/10 15:29:31<stoopkid> project*
09/10 15:32:36<jmv_> So , https://wordlift.io/ does not fulfill its promises ?
09/10 15:34:54<stoopkid> never used it, i just couldn't imagine using wordpress for a project sophisticated enough to be asking for AI of any sort
09/10 15:37:14<stoopkid> but then again, i'm new to wordpress and i'm not an AI dev so what do i really know heh
09/10 15:49:59<jmv_> :)
09/10 15:55:57<stoopkid> https://smartblogger.com/wordpress-hosting/
09/10 15:56:35<stoopkid> after reading this i have absolutely no clue why anybody would opt to host on wordpress.com rather than just setting up the free/opensource wordpress software themselves
09/10 16:00:21<stoopkid> "$3750/mo to use custom plugins" wtf
09/10 16:02:14<stoopkid> so you might be paying over $4000/mo to get all their "extra" features (which are just standard features in the actual wordpress software), and they can still shut down your account at their discretion without notice or justification

09/10 17:34:06<jmv_> indeed , stoopkid, but there are many hosting offers for wp .
09/10 17:34:58<stoopkid> sure that's what makes me wonder why anybody would use wordpress.com's hosting

09/10 21:45:01<editable-koo>yo
09/10 21:45:35<editable-koo>so i contacted an old friend and he just finished a bechelor in marketing or management or somesuch and is looking for a job
09/10 21:46:08<editable-koo>ive been explaining a bit of newshit to him
09/10 21:47:14<stoopkid> nice, is he interested?
09/10 21:48:32<editable-koo>dunno yet
09/10 21:49:12<editable-koo>ill keep talking to him
09/10 21:49:23<editable-koo>he used to do flash animations btw
09/10 21:50:34<editable-koo>well my ex had been doing some flyer designs
09/10 21:50:53<editable-koo>and maybe other photoshop stuff here and there
09/10 21:51:48<editable-koo>probably not website design
09/10 21:52:16<editable-koo>we were reworking a flash banner once
09/10 21:52:26<editable-koo>ActionScript
09/10 21:52:29<editable-koo>never again
09/10 21:54:24<editable-koo>well the tau logo really looked like for a hotdog stand in the end
09/10 21:54:45<editable-koo>it was a bit of a design by comittee tho:)
09/10 21:55:34<editable-koo>but yea got ohad impressed enough for a while
09/10 21:57:54<stoopkid> well if you'd wanna try to bring either of them into this i'd be down to try and work with them and see how that goes; i'm not worried if they don't have software/web-dev experience since we've already got that reasonably well covered anyway and the main thing we could use at this point is soft-skills to help break us into the markets
09/10 21:59:50<editable-koo>https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/?q=wordpress
09/10 22:01:26<editable-koo>yea ill try to scout the terrain over next days
09/10 22:03:04<editable-koo>and maybe old hdds, theres got to be a webpage i put together with her "portfolio" kind of links
09/10 22:04:41<editable-koo>http://asset-2.soupcdn.com/asset/13935/9351_2a52_520.jpeg
09/10 22:04:43<editable-koo>not this
09/10 22:07:54<stoopkid> i've got a friend here who also recently got a bachelor's in marketing/management/something. i've been trying to get him involved with shit since tau-chain since i know he's got a head on his shoulders for that type of thing and that i can fully trust him when it comes to money, unfortunately though he'd never work on anything unless it was already paying
              <stoopkid> him
09/10 22:08:34<editable-koo>speaking of design, if anyone still has flash: http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/
09/10 22:09:00<editable-koo>smart guy
09/10 22:09:04<editable-koo>your friend
09/10 22:10:08<stoopkid> heh, he often says stuff like "man i wish i was smart like you with math and computers and stuff" and i'm like "man i wish i was smart like you with not going broke regularly"
09/10 22:10:45<stoopkid> "wanna trade?" "nah.."
09/10 22:23:24<stoopkid> oh actually i've told you about that guy before; that's the guy that i was living with him and his dad until i moved back in with my parents last year
09/10 22:23:40<stoopkid> and if i don't start making money by november i might be living him again
09/10 22:23:45<stoopkid> living with*
09/10 22:25:17<stoopkid> but, there's actually a shitload of non-software work i could do for them for income during the next year
09/10 22:29:47<stoopkid> just random shit that you usually can't find a dedicated person for like cleaning their kitchen or going up to his grandparents' house to scare the snakes out
09/10 22:34:43<stoopkid> hell, i'd get bit by a venomous snake right now just to be able to have a story from my recent life that isn't just what software i've been working on

09/14 21:07:31<stoopkid> yo
09/14 21:07:47<editable-koo>yo
09/14 21:07:53<stoopkid> it's goin alright, how bout you
09/14 21:08:12<editable-koo>yea too
09/14 21:08:59<editable-koo>the usual shit aside hehe
09/14 21:09:44<editable-koo>i was thinking i should try to take a look at the scala stuff
09/14 21:10:31<stoopkid> i'm gonna hold off on that til i'm more set up with other things
09/14 21:20:57<sirdancealot> computing graph proximity isnt my cuppa
09/14 21:22:27<sirdancealot> at least the lib it depends on has some test data
09/14 21:25:11<sirdancealot> in some undocumented format
09/14 21:25:27<stoopkid> wrt theoretical/advanced stuff i'm probably only really gonna work much on tau and maybe some lemon if you've got specific ideas for it
09/14 21:26:27<sirdancealot> lemon is full of specific ideas
09/14 21:27:34<sirdancealot> but working on it is like advancing on a WW1 battlefield
09/14 21:27:52<stoopkid> heh
09/14 21:29:18<sirdancealot> one specific idea is getting the precedence/associativity stuff done but i dont feel like diving into it myself
09/14 21:29:44<sirdancealot> i get by with the editor
09/14 21:31:05<sirdancealot> i guess untill you have a specific use for it yourself, i cant get you into it
09/14 21:31:28<sirdancealot> meanwhile, i have some kind of vision that ill be bashing towards
09/14 21:32:53<sirdancealot> probably mostly in the areas of desktop shell language and data management
09/14 21:33:25<sirdancealot> personal uses
09/14 21:35:13<sirdancealot> buuut...im thinking id really appreciate if you looked into jmv's stuff
09/14 21:35:27<sirdancealot> i can set it up and make it build and stuff
09/14 21:35:54<stoopkid> sure if you've got anything in particular you want me to look at i can check it out
09/14 21:35:55<sirdancealot> and you could make sense of the test data and come up with a few tests
09/14 21:36:47<sirdancealot> im pretty curious what other work jmv would have in store for us, it could be a great connection wrt all our other interests
09/14 21:37:38<stoopkid> wrt lemon i've got ideas for what i'd like out of such a system, just haven't gotten around to really working it out
09/14 21:38:56<stoopkid> and yea, i agree. it's just a lot to jump into while i've gotta figure out all this other crap so i just don't wanna dive into it at this point until i've got that stuff figured out
09/14 21:39:43<sirdancealot> yeah, for me its kinda cramming it too
09/14 21:40:20<sirdancealot> but lets see...
09/14 21:42:48<sirdancealot> was i right about phpmyadmin?
09/14 21:43:35<stoopkid> it's no mysql workbench but it's open source and i can get the job done just as effectively without the slight extra conveniences
09/14 21:44:44<stoopkid> plus as a web developer who recently learned wordpress which is centered around mysql & php, i should probably have it on my tool-belt :)
09/14 21:46:14<stoopkid> setting it up manually and playing with the configuration files was definitely educational as well, might be the most valuable thing i got out of it (not to discredit the other things)
09/14 21:46:24<sirdancealot> cool
09/14 21:47:14<stoopkid> still haven't got to remote access my server but that's because my web-host has everything split up weird and i'm trying to figure out how to set up remote access (if i can)
09/14 21:48:11<stoopkid> could set one up on your ec2 to test it out, but i need to figure out how to do this anyway heh
09/14 21:50:11<stoopkid> also been procrastinating on IDEs for all the languages i work with
09/14 21:50:28<stoopkid> i get by on vim but i feel i need to step up my game a bit
09/14 21:51:01<sirdancealot> depends how deep you go with vim
09/14 21:51:12<stoopkid> i don't :)
09/14 21:51:17<stoopkid> but maybe i could
09/14 21:51:37<sirdancealot> if you use all the modes and stuffs then id think it would be a fine route
09/14 21:51:55<stoopkid> i guess i need to make some time to check that out
09/14 21:51:57<stoopkid> ah
09/14 21:51:59<stoopkid> schedules
09/14 21:52:02<stoopkid> those things
09/14 21:52:05<stoopkid> i should make one
09/14 21:52:57<sirdancealot> as on phpmyadmin it doesnt seem to be in the repos of that weird aws distro, so i guess its download the tgz and ..stuff
09/14 21:54:55<sirdancealot> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/phpMyAdmin#Lighttpd
09/14 21:56:38<sirdancealot> my right hand has been hurting .. i wonder if its the shitty workplace setup , or just much clicking that i have to do there
09/14 21:56:50<sirdancealot> *too
09/14 21:57:12<sirdancealot> i should bring a second keyboard tomorrow
09/14 21:57:36<sirdancealot> and maybe take time off typing over the end of the week
09/14 21:57:42<stoopkid> that's how my hand got when i had to do the circuit diagrams on the plc
09/14 21:58:06<sirdancealot> i c
09/14 21:58:24<stoopkid> is my key in authorized_users?
09/14 21:59:23<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 21:59:35<sirdancealot> ec2-user
09/14 22:00:04<stoopkid> i'm getting permission denied (public key)
09/14 22:00:19<stoopkid> is this what's in there?
09/14 22:00:24<stoopkid> ssh-rsa
              <stoopkid> AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDM85VnibHKQTBNfqgNyNmT7nANAlBky5YAAqZuxIRmia6o9reE5Rv4s6j3V+bVPCt+aBWtYdOmJBH9+eM4T5CXFt6B2pZYXHZZpEhbtUD4YDiNEBMxjxh7vL6OQziuoye5z9MxUxf9r/PtmMzExkBqSiDWWdnTYPFy0CYFJVp1RlwX8M1A0diqf5l0S09aacxwdTEIN5kisnx82NBSKYlAEDRh086WMsEi36gpy5YovWVY3U/FfVHGxkif4mHVVIfuTVXvm1XKly/apUDZXtEdu7LzZSwVscPw0ipUbdsT1qwwPfJlYMLetmsfoop9OOKJaKud35/4
09/14 22:00:25<stoopkid> QHQjEpUAv4nf stoopkid@stoopkid-SVF15323CXW
09/14 22:00:30<sirdancealot> no
09/14 22:00:53<stoopkid> maybe i haven't been on there since i reinstalled my os
09/14 22:01:19<sirdancealot> ok now
09/14 22:01:49<stoopkid> still denied
09/14 22:03:22<sirdancealot> hmm
09/14 22:03:43<sirdancealot> whats your command line?
09/14 22:04:08<stoopkid> nvm i'm in
09/14 22:04:39<stoopkid> i had sudo in there out of habit and it must check a different spot for the ssh keys
09/14 22:05:10<sirdancealot> alright run a new tmux session or a screen session for the phpmyadmin stuff
09/14 22:05:29<sirdancealot> yea that would be /root i guess
09/14 22:26:35<stoopkid> as far as languages go, what i really want to set up is a dependent type theory system incorporating category theory
09/14 22:27:05<sirdancealot> works for me
09/14 22:32:50<sirdancealot> i got the custom node thing working
09/14 22:33:05<sirdancealot> so next time we're defining a language, it wont be from within python
09/14 22:33:44<stoopkid> nice
09/14 22:34:08<sirdancealot> if we first fix up the parser, we can work with everything stored as text, will be easier for collaboration over tmux
09/14 22:36:54<sirdancealot> if this hand pain keeps up im gonna shift my priorities to aural ui again
09/14 22:37:49<stoopkid> i'm still down for natural lang stuff for that, though my ideas are still mostly limited to type theory stuff
09/14 22:44:32<stoopkid> i wanna run something by you and see if it makes sense, it's pretty simple
09/14 22:44:47<sirdancealot> alright
09/14 22:45:08<sirdancealot> im tempted to say you should first define what making sense means but ok
09/14 22:46:54<stoopkid> let's say i've got a set, A, and proposition that asks whether objects in A satisfy some property
09/14 22:47:09<stoopkid> like, given an object from A, you're asking whether this property holds for that object
09/14 22:47:35<sirdancealot> ok
09/14 22:48:25<stoopkid> you could say that this proposition defines a subset of A, namely the subset where all the objects satisfy the property
09/14 22:48:58<stoopkid> and then there's other objects which don't satisfy the property, and aren't in the subset
09/14 22:49:15<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 22:49:43<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 22:50:40<stoopkid> alright, so, let's say you've got another set B, and a function f:B->A
09/14 22:51:01<stoopkid> do you see how a function maps the domain into a subset of the range?
09/14 22:51:16<stoopkid> i.e. f maps the objects in B into a subset of the objects in A?
09/14 22:51:58<stoopkid> (the subset might be the whole set but it's still a subset)
09/14 22:52:59<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 22:54:00<stoopkid> alright, so, we can pick out any subset of A using propositions that the objects must satisfy, and we can do the same using functions from B->A
09/14 22:54:18<stoopkid> and we can get all the subsets with either one
09/14 22:55:36<stoopkid> so, we might just say that propositions on A and functions from B->A are the same thing
09/14 22:56:23<sirdancealot> same thing for the purpose of ending up with sets of A
09/14 22:57:31<stoopkid> so, before going further, can you see how this corresponds to existential quantification over A?
09/14 22:58:34<stoopkid> "there exists a:A such that the property holds for a"
09/14 22:59:12<stoopkid> existential quantification over a set also defines a subset, and it's the same thing as the subset defined by the propositions and by the functions
09/14 22:59:29<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:00:34<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 23:02:27<stoopkid> alright, so not only does the function f:B->A correspond to a subset of A, it also corresponds to a *family* of subsets of B
09/14 23:02:45<stoopkid> specifically a partition of B
09/14 23:03:02<stoopkid> you know what a partition is in this context?
09/14 23:03:22<stoopkid> (in the context of subsets of a set)
09/14 23:03:40<sirdancealot> well you mean that the function can be used on different sets for input
09/14 23:03:58<sirdancealot> B
09/14 23:04:54<stoopkid> hrm, not quite. so a partition divides up a set into non-overlapping sets which cover the whole set
09/14 23:05:22<sirdancealot> two?
09/14 23:05:53<stoopkid> any number generally, you'll see where that number would come from in this case in a second
09/14 23:06:09<sirdancealot> i dont see how the preposition corresponds to stuff in B if we're talking about how it corresponds to stuff in A
09/14 23:07:10<stoopkid> alright, so let's say i pick an object a in A. it's got what's called a preimage, wrt the mapping f:B->A
09/14 23:07:12<sirdancealot> except in the sense that it divides subsets of B into those where all members have a corresponding A and where they dont
09/14 23:07:22<stoopkid> exactly
09/14 23:07:36<stoopkid> that's the partition of B
09/14 23:08:00<sirdancealot> ok so two partitions in this case
09/14 23:08:26<stoopkid> two partitions?
09/14 23:09:49<stoopkid> the number of subsets of B will be the same as the number of distinct elements of A that get mapped to
09/14 23:10:25<stoopkid> (one non-overlapping subset of B for the distinct element of A that this subset maps to)
09/14 23:11:49<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:12:16<sirdancealot> no, and frankly im out of wood at this point
09/14 23:12:32<sirdancealot> firewood
09/14 23:14:06<sirdancealot> two in the sense that you have elements of B that map to A and elements of B that dont
09/14 23:14:25<stoopkid> ah
09/14 23:15:10<stoopkid> well, actually every element of B will map to some element of A
09/14 23:15:23<stoopkid> the function acts on every element and returns an A
09/14 23:15:40<stoopkid> just not necessarily a distinct A, and not necessarily every A gets returned
09/14 23:16:19<stoopkid> so, in the set A there are two partitions, those that do get returned by f for some B, and those that don't
09/14 23:16:34<stoopkid> but *every* B gets assigned to *some* A
09/14 23:16:41<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:17:01<sirdancealot> ok
09/14 23:17:27<stoopkid> so, you do get a partition in B, but in a different way
09/14 23:17:55<sirdancealot> you get clusters of elements that map to the same value
09/14 23:18:06<stoopkid> exactly
09/14 23:18:19<stoopkid> so you can reverse that mapping and map values to clusters
09/14 23:18:41<stoopkid> that's called preimage, i.e. the preimage of an object in A is the cluster of elements that map to it
09/14 23:19:52<stoopkid> ok so, when we started out, B was just a set, but now because of this function f:B->A, it looks like a partition, with each cluster in the partition corresponding to some element of A
09/14 23:20:15<stoopkid> i.e., this set B is now "indexed" by this other set A, in a sense
09/14 23:20:55<stoopkid> now, consider the dependent sum, the existential quantifier in type theory
09/14 23:21:03<stoopkid> Sigma a:A . B(a)
09/14 23:21:26<stoopkid> what are the B(a)? they're the clusters in B
09/14 23:21:36<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:23:57<sirdancealot> hmm
09/14 23:24:38<sirdancealot> not sure how to read this
09/14 23:25:01<stoopkid> anything in particular?
09/14 23:25:16<sirdancealot> the whole thing
09/14 23:25:35<sirdancealot> does this define a type of things?
09/14 23:26:54<stoopkid> hrm.. just stick to thinking of them as sets and functions for now and you'll see exactly how they end up corresponding to sigma types and pi-types
09/14 23:27:21<sirdancealot> whats the part after the dot?
09/14 23:27:46<stoopkid> after Sigma a:A . ?
09/14 23:28:11<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 23:28:32<stoopkid> ah woops, B(a) would be the cluster in B that maps to a
09/14 23:29:06<stoopkid> so, you know how the sigma type is a pair-type where the type of the second element can vary depending on the first element?
09/14 23:29:19<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 23:29:23<stoopkid> depending on the value* of the first element
09/14 23:29:30<stoopkid> that's what we essentially have here
09/14 23:29:55<sirdancealot> well
09/14 23:29:59<stoopkid> the clusters are the different "second-element types" corresponding to the different first element values
09/14 23:30:39<sirdancealot> but you left out the function
09/14 23:30:49<stoopkid> f:B->A?
09/14 23:31:11<sirdancealot> yea the f
09/14 23:32:18<stoopkid> for the sigma-type the f basically just defines what are the clusters in B and how they correspond to values in A (i.e. how the second-element type varies by the first-element value)
09/14 23:33:35<sirdancealot> if the f is not somehow a part of the "Sigma bla bla..." type declaration, then i have no way of actually instantiating that type
09/14 23:34:03<sirdancealot> or really no clue what you mean with it
09/14 23:36:38<stoopkid> alright, let's say you choose an arbitrary partition of B, i.e. any arbitrary way to cluster it's values, into N different clusters
09/14 23:37:14<stoopkid> and then you choose a collection of N distinct points in A
09/14 23:37:42<stoopkid> then you choose a way to pair clusters to points
09/14 23:38:47<sirdancealot> ok
09/14 23:39:31<stoopkid> so, given a point in A, paired to a cluster in B, you get some collection of pairs with an element in A and an element in the cluster of B
09/14 23:39:36<stoopkid> these are proofs of the sigma type
09/14 23:40:17<stoopkid> proofs that this point in A satisfies the property B
09/14 23:40:49<stoopkid> what do you need to prove Sigma a:A . B(a)? you need a pair where the first element is an object a:A and the second element is an object b:B(a)
09/14 23:43:05<stoopkid> so, wrt defining the sigma type here, imagine if you took the function f and drew an arrow from every point in B to the point it maps to in A
09/14 23:43:45<stoopkid> then these arrows (or their end-points i guess) are all the proofs of the sigma type
09/14 23:46:38<stoopkid> so, the sigma type is really all pairs (a,b) such that a is an element of A and b is an element of B(a)
09/14 23:47:20<stoopkid> which is just all the pairs of end-points in the arrows mapping inputs to outputs in the function f
09/14 23:47:47<stoopkid> does this make sense?
09/14 23:48:36<sirdancealot> i think i can follow
09/14 23:49:42<stoopkid> alright so, now let's say i have this same clustering in B, so for every a:A i have the same B(a)
09/14 23:49:57<stoopkid> (same as before, not same as each other)
09/14 23:50:31<stoopkid> now let's say i make a function going the other direction, g: A -> B
09/14 23:51:19<stoopkid> and let's say we add the constraints that g must map every object a:A to an element in B(a)
09/14 23:51:53<stoopkid> now we've got a dependent function, a pi-type, instead of a sigma-type
09/14 23:52:32<stoopkid> see how g is a function where the range type varies depending on the input value?
09/14 23:56:56<stoopkid> (i promise it's nearly over btw)
09/14 23:59:26<sirdancealot> mkay
09/15 00:02:35<stoopkid> if you understand everything up to this point then you understand how to express existential and universal quantification (dependent sums and products) using fairly basic properties of the behavior of functions
09/15 00:03:14<stoopkid> just to recap: every function f:B->A defines an existential quantification i.e. sigma type over it's domain , i.e. Sigma a:A . B(a)
09/15 00:03:57<sirdancealot> its every function now?
09/15 00:04:07<stoopkid> always was
09/15 00:05:11<stoopkid> every function has those properties of defining of subset of it's codomain and partitioning it's domain, right?
09/15 00:05:42<sirdancealot> yea ok
09/15 00:08:25<stoopkid> alright, so if you have a partition of B and associate each cluster in B to some distinct point in A, then if you have a function g: A -> B such that every point a:A maps to an object in B(a), i.e. the cluster in B associated to a, then this function g is essentially a dependent function right?
09/15 00:08:42<stoopkid> Pi a:A . B(a)
09/15 00:09:39<stoopkid> this function g is actually a proof of the type Pi a:A . B(a)
09/15 00:10:20<stoopkid> so, g applies to all elements in A, so it's like saying "for every a:A, the property B(a) holds"
09/15 00:10:57<stoopkid> alright, sanity check before we go any furhter
09/15 00:11:46<stoopkid> i'm claiming we have a way to express "there exists" and "for all" here, and it seems like it should work but let's make sure it passes some basic tests
09/15 00:12:37<stoopkid> so if i say "there exists a:A such that B(a)", this is defining a subset of A, where all the members of this subset have the property B

if you're confused about any of this just ask and i'll draw pictures

09/15 00:13:16<stoopkid> if any objects in A aren't members of this subset, then there exists a:A such that *NOT* B(a)
09/15 00:13:42<stoopkid> which means that the statement "for all a:A, B(a)" couldn't possibly be true
09/15 00:14:22<stoopkid> this means that we shouldn't be able to construct a function g: A -> B such that we can assign each object a:A to an object b:B(a)
09/15 00:14:55<sirdancealot> sorry gotta sleep now, we can try to continue tomorrow

09/15 18:01:40<sirdancealot> yo
09/15 18:04:48<stoopkid> yo
09/15 18:24:09<stoopkid> alright i guess i should start with a PHP IDE since i can hypothetically do all my web shit from that
09/15 20:48:29*** Quit: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@109.107.211.244) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 272 seconds
09/15 20:51:53<stoopkid> i guess i should start making lists of what features i'm even looking for
09/15 21:00:46<stoopkid> as far as just text-editing and code-highlighting goes, i don't really need anything beyond what vim offers
09/15 21:01:20<stoopkid> would be nice if whatever i was using was integrated with git and FTP though
09/15 21:01:41<stoopkid> but, that's not a big deal, i can use other tools for all that
09/15 21:02:24<stoopkid> what vim really lacks is searching code, being able to click a name and find it's definition, all that stuff
09/15 21:02:49<stoopkid> and i'm not enough of a command-line pro to make up for it
09/15 21:03:04<stoopkid> (though maybe that's something i should fix)
09/15 21:19:25<stoopkid> yea everything i'm reading mostly suggests to me to just become awesome with vim..
09/15 22:42:49<stoopkid> what would be nice, along the lines of the lemon shell, is a tool that can interpret code or commands for you anywhere
09/15 22:43:10<stoopkid> for example, i want to install some software
09/15 22:43:25<stoopkid> there's a command line for it: " curl http://beyondgrep.com/ack-2.14-single-file > ~/bin/ack && chmod 0755 !#:3 "
09/15 22:43:51<stoopkid> i don't know off-hand what "!#:3" means, nor do i have a great idea of how to even go about finding
09/15 22:43:55<stoopkid> finding it*
09/15 22:44:34<stoopkid> somebody who knows linux a lot better than i do would probably be like "oh that's... " and then i'd say "okay", and that would be the end of that
09/15 22:44:45<stoopkid> until i run into the same situation again
09/15 22:45:11<stoopkid> would be nice if the computer could just tell me
09/15 22:45:53<stoopkid> assuming the line is a valid command line, then (by definition) it has all the tools it needs to actually interpret it and even execute it
09/15 22:46:56<stoopkid> and yet it doesn't know how to tell me this without actually running the command, who's ultimate effect isn't something i can determine yet

09/16 01:12:25<editable-koo>node "chmod command line" with syntax: ["chmod", chmod command line mode, chmod command line gibberish]
09/16 01:13:03<editable-koo>we are close..
09/16 01:21:15<editable-koo>iirc i was calling this idea "lesh" at one point
09/16 03:42:15<stoopkid> which idea?
09/16 03:50:26<sirdancealot> describing an ordinary shell language in lemon, ..
09/16 03:52:25<stoopkid> ah, yea should've been able to tell that
09/16 03:53:59<sirdancealot> yesterday i created my first qt gui app
09/16 03:54:39<sirdancealot> with tableView with some stuff
09/16 03:54:42<sirdancealot> kinda cool
09/16 03:55:16<sirdancealot> i could start applying this to building the new lemon gui right away
09/16 03:55:55<stoopkid> nice, i guess i should start learning it then
09/16 03:56:12<sirdancealot> sorry about your math stuff...its just almost excruciating to read and follow what you say
09/16 03:56:26<stoopkid> lol no worries
09/16 03:56:29<sirdancealot> shrug..you cant study everything at once
09/16 03:58:07<stoopkid> i'm rethinking and simplifying a lot of it anyway
09/16 03:59:27<stoopkid> speaking of which, i decided i should start a math blog
09/16 03:59:43<sirdancealot> i was thinking i should start a software hate blog
09/16 04:00:00<stoopkid> i read and write about it all the time, just not on a permanent place that might get views from people searching the internet
09/16 04:00:08<stoopkid> heh
09/16 04:14:19<stoopkid> alright i've got a better way to explain the math thing, it'll be 100x shorter and i don't think it'll be excruciating, just want to see if the concept is accessible, i'll pastebin it
09/16 04:17:31<sirdancealot> ok
09/16 05:02:01<stoopkid> http://pastebin.com/fkJT1D7G
09/16 08:37:04<stoopkid> i'm a fan of the idea of editors that prevent you from making erroneous code
09/16 08:38:03<stoopkid> just needs to be coupled with the ability to make incomplete code & code with errors, as long as it's separated
09/16 08:43:12<stoopkid> or, better, instead of not giving you the option to change the code into an error state, it gives you the option to restrict yourself to moves that don't put it into an error state, if that's what you want to do
09/16 09:12:03<sirdancealot> sure
09/16 10:31:54<stoopkid> so, as a lang for defining langs, i think this would make a good basis for a tool for reverse-engineering software
09/16 10:32:11<stoopkid> which is something i'm definitely interested in, cause i have to do it the hard way all the time
09/16 10:35:38<stoopkid> essentially layered decompilation
09/16 10:38:13<stoopkid> you get some binary file, you don't know what it is, so you disassemble the binary, into a description of an executable containing assembly and data, and then you further decompile parts of this executable, etc.. storing a layered model that has the description at each layer
09/16 10:40:19<stoopkid> you'd want a lang for expressing langs for this because you'd need to be able to extend it with definitions of existing languages so it can decompile according to them and also definitions of languages you create yourself, for custom reverse engineering
09/16 10:41:28<stoopkid> for example, let's say that gcc has a bug, and it's not compiling right
09/16 10:41:52<stoopkid> then obviously for the decompilation you can't use the existing c language definition
09/16 10:42:11<stoopkid> there might not be any language definition you can use beyond the disassembly
09/16 10:42:25<stoopkid> that's where the need for custom languages comes in
09/16 10:42:30<stoopkid> (at least one place)
09/16 10:43:43<stoopkid> beyond this, you can think of applying it not just to an executable binary file, but any binary file at all, like all the memory on your computer
09/16 10:44:37<stoopkid> for example, you've got the bootloader section of your computer, it's got a particular file format, you might want to use/define a language to decompile it into a representation that you can work with
09/16 10:45:45<stoopkid> if lemon shell is something that's actually acting as a shell, then you can use this as the interface to control your computer from
09/16 10:48:07<stoopkid> i guess you could describe it as a shell where languages and the things you do with them are first-class constructs
09/16 10:49:09<stoopkid> idk, maybe i should ponder some unix philosophy here
09/16 10:50:34<stoopkid> we have various things we want to incorporate into this and it's already fairly monolithic as it is, is there a logical way we can break it up into interoperable but self-contained components that together get the whole job done?
09/16 11:00:54<stoopkid> here's essentially how i imagine this. on unix everything is a file. on lemon, every file has a language (or set or hierarchy(s) of them)
09/16 11:02:01<stoopkid> you have a system which essentially holds all your language definitions and different mappings between them
09/16 11:02:50<stoopkid> so it holds all your language definitions and all your compilers and decompilers
09/16 11:03:25<stoopkid> and gives you a feature-set that let's you easily use these "anywhere"
09/16 11:05:16<stoopkid> your languages are different syntaxes, and the mappings between them essentially give them semantics in terms of each other, but there's a particular semantics that we'd be concerned with here, and that's the semantics of a syntax in terms of rules defined in a formal, machine-interpretable logic
09/16 11:05:23<stoopkid> like, MLTT for example
09/16 11:06:49<stoopkid> this particular semantics is where go beyond saying "this c++ maps into this assembly" and say something like "this is what this assembly *does*, mathematically speaking"
09/16 11:08:37<stoopkid> so, then i see "shell" stuff as a separate component
09/16 11:09:24<stoopkid> the stuff before was purely about language definitions, and it's self-contained so why push it
09/16 11:11:18<stoopkid> yea, one could imagine using what i've laid out so far on another operating system or shell, so best to just leave that as-is, it's purely about languages
09/16 11:13:16<sirdancealot> yea the shell should be a library
09/16 11:14:16<stoopkid> i'm basically imagining it as a system that opens up all the details of your computer to description & interface through the language-definitions system
09/16 11:14:42<sirdancealot> well, youre imagining a pie in the sky
09/16 11:15:52<stoopkid> hrm, i don't think so
09/16 11:16:49<sirdancealot> ah, opens up , yea then
09/16 11:17:42<stoopkid> hrm? what did you think i was saying?
09/16 11:18:50<sirdancealot> that youre imagining the finished thing, with all the details of your computer covered
09/16 11:20:44<stoopkid> ah, yea no. a system that would have basic things covered like basic disassembly maybe, for some select few popular systems, but would then let you use the language-definitions system to extend this and get a better picture of your system the more language-definition you put into it
09/16 11:22:33<stoopkid> like, essentially you'd have a relatively simple system that just let's you store language definitions and various parsers, compilers, decompilers, etc.. for them in an organized place that makes it easy to use any of them at whim
09/16 11:23:48<sirdancealot> yea well thats just a subthing of the system that lets you store and organize all other stuff
09/16 11:27:45<stoopkid> that's possible, i hadn't thought of that
09/16 11:28:23<stoopkid> this language-definitions thing is pretty self-contained though, definitely something that hypothetically should be able to work by itself
09/16 11:30:35<sirdancealot> well yea
09/16 11:30:49<sirdancealot> we didnt run mltt thru the shell, did we?
09/16 11:31:15<stoopkid> didn't we?
09/16 11:31:57<stoopkid> or do you mean the lemon shell
09/16 11:32:11<sirdancealot> lemon shell
09/16 11:32:20<stoopkid> no i don't think we did
09/16 11:39:19<stoopkid> so, i think we'd want to be able to use the logical framework where we're interpreting our languages to also impose constraints on the state of the system through the shell
09/16 11:40:02<stoopkid> for example, you might want to impose some constraints on your bootloader section of memory
09/16 11:40:31<sirdancealot> what logical framework?
09/16 11:41:28<stoopkid> like MLTT
09/16 11:43:06<stoopkid> with languages, if you want the computer to "understand" them, i.e. be able to reason about them, then you have to express their semantics in terms of some system of machine-interpretable formal logic, like MLTT for instance
09/16 11:43:52<stoopkid> and if you want to impose constraints on your computer, you also need a system of machine-interpretable formal logic to express those
09/16 11:44:56<stoopkid> just like you need a type-system to express constraints on your programs
09/16 11:46:29<stoopkid> so, like with the languages, this isn't "everything's gonna be expressed in logic", it would be "anything can be related into logic"
09/16 11:47:19<stoopkid> so, you can progressively give the system more vocabulary with the languages and more understanding with the logic
09/16 11:48:48<stoopkid> the rest of the shell would just be like.. a shell, or, whatever other additions we have for that
09/16 11:51:07<stoopkid> this is just my addition to it :)
09/16 11:51:52<sirdancealot> sounds good
09/16 12:01:54<stoopkid> so, we talked a bit before about how one of the big difficulties in CNL (and one of the big reasons actual NLP is still out of the question) is that the language is highly dependent on the concepts, so it actually needs to have some kind of "understanding" of the concepts (and the current situation, and sometimes even the history leading up to it) in order
09/16 12:01:55<stoopkid> to figure out what to do based on what you're saying
09/16 12:05:40<stoopkid> so, all these concepts need to be made machine-interpretable and collected into a database that it can use for processing
09/16 12:07:32<stoopkid> now, you brought up earlier the system for organizing everything
09/16 12:08:55<stoopkid> well, there's a database of lots of information, then it's mainly a matter of translating between database of information <--> logic <--> language
09/16 12:15:28<stoopkid> for actual NLP, which we'd need for the voice-controlled-computer, this is how i'd go about that:
09/16 12:16:48<stoopkid> you can use the language-definitions system to define languages, like a CNL
09/16 12:17:32<stoopkid> the CNL can be made to work with the logic framework, to interface between the language and a database of logical concepts, so that it can actually have an understanding of your CNL
09/16 12:19:41<stoopkid> for NLP, this is basically how i think of it, first, the computer attempts to interpret it through CNL
09/16 12:20:34<stoopkid> this inevitably fails in most cases, but different parts of the sentence will usually match some part of the CNL, so it's got something to work with
09/16 12:21:38<stoopkid> the rest of the parts that aren't interpretable by the CNL then get examined further
09/16 12:22:22<stoopkid> here you can employ any arbitrary method to try to guess how it should be interpreted
09/16 12:23:30<stoopkid> like for example taking some neural net and running it on the text and seeing what's the closest known CNL text it might be, or checks a bunch of things it might be to see if they fit with the sentence
09/16 12:24:13<stoopkid> now, the trick is, you can use any arbitrary method to try to determine a meaning, but you only accept that meaning if it "makes sense"
09/16 12:25:29<stoopkid> and you might say that "making sense" is that the sentence corresponds to some well-formed concept in the logic, which isn't the False concept
09/16 12:28:54<stoopkid> so, i would use neural nets here because they can be progressively trained on the NLP data
09/16 12:29:33<stoopkid> think of it like this, you use the same concept for interpreting voice to words
09/16 12:32:00<stoopkid> you can use any arbitrary method (usually neural nets or some other AI) to try to guess what the word is, but you only accept it if the sounds actually correspond to a word and not just random noises
09/16 12:33:20<stoopkid> then what we do is build legs for this thing and tell it to get us a beer :)
09/16 12:40:00<stoopkid> so, you'd have a situational awareness component, which is dependent on the logic and the database of concepts
09/16 12:40:12<stoopkid> this is necessary for the voice-to-code
09/16 12:40:27<stoopkid> or, i should say more generally, voice-controlled-computer
09/16 12:41:09<stoopkid> i.e. there would be concepts in the database representing the current situation, and logic to reason about it
09/16 12:44:08<stoopkid> i think it's also necessary for general non-voice CNL as well, if it's to work for documents of any length / complexity
09/16 12:47:54<stoopkid> i.e. it needs to understand how there are different situations at different parts of the document, and how to reason about this
09/16 12:51:20<stoopkid> this is pretty complex, but that's the system you want right? extensible CNL-aware voice-controlled computer
09/16 12:52:49<stoopkid> also, what we build at first doesn't have to look anywhere near this complex
09/16 12:53:15<stoopkid> it's just packaging for what will eventually go into it
09/16 13:03:10<sirdancealot> sure
09/16 13:08:04<stoopkid> setting up the logic and allowing it to work with a database is easy; we've already built an MLTT. making this language-definitions system isn't too hard either, especially since you've already got a lot done toward it with lemon. to relate a language to logic, we express that language in the logic and then relate it to other concepts there
09/16 13:08:20<stoopkid> that goes for CNL too. that would just be the easiest way to do it, afaict
09/16 13:10:17<sirdancealot> i need to fix up mostly the parser and the menu
09/16 13:13:18<sirdancealot> still havent finished the "make this useful to myself" stage
09/16 13:15:29<sirdancealot> once im done with that and i have more shell-type functionality, (and czech internationalization of the most important stuff) im seriously thinking ill contact the guy i once worked with, ask if he'd want to invest in this
09/16 13:15:42<stoopkid> that'd be cool
09/16 13:18:08<stoopkid> somebody showed me how to define languages in agda, so once we have the language definition stuff worked out in lemon we could automatically map the syntax of languages into the logic so that you can immediately get started with relating the vocabulary to other concepts
09/16 13:20:50<stoopkid> i guess everything can hypothetically be framed within the logic, it just might only have very simple logic applied to it at first
09/16 13:23:21<stoopkid> but then again, it shouldn't be monolithic, so having the language-definition system separate from the logic makes sense to me, though we can still provide the automatic mapping of the language syntax into the logic (whenever possible; i don't think there would be much limitation here) so that you can get started defining the semantics right away
09/16 13:26:42<sirdancealot> http://www.mobility.siemens.com/mobility/global/de/nahverkehr/strassenverkehr/Documents/webfeature-smart-mobility-solutions/index.en.html
09/16 13:28:35<stoopkid> i never knew how much siemens had to do with my traffic experience
09/16 13:29:32<sirdancealot> yea youd barely find your toilet without them
09/16 13:30:07<sirdancealot> srsly tho im pondering sending them my cv
09/16 13:30:14<stoopkid> they're doing a terrible job with the traffic in baltimore heh
09/16 13:30:20<sirdancealot> hehe
09/16 13:30:33<stoopkid> you should, they'd probably pay well if they hired you
09/16 13:31:45<stoopkid> i'm pretty sure they're multinational so i don't think you'd have a problem there, and the elektroline work demonstrates that you can work on exactly this kind of stuff
09/16 13:34:33<stoopkid> wrt this system i'm describing, just to be clear, when i say that the semantics would be defined in the logic, that doesn't mean that this would be the only place that you can define semantics, but the rest would be just whatever you want to do with the language-definition system, cause that includes your compilers, parsers, syntax-highlighting, etc..
09/16 13:36:16<stoopkid> but, when it comes to having something like voice-controlled-computer or something that can logically integrate the information on your computer, you need to single out a system of *logic* in order to do it
09/16 13:37:23<stoopkid> you might say that you can use different systems of logic for different things
09/16 13:38:07<stoopkid> and you can, but then those things can't be logically related anymore, so it's kind of deficient to have any more than one logic for the purposes of a thing doing reasoning
09/16 13:39:32<stoopkid> so, whatever logic you pick, you want to try to express as many concepts and relations as possible in that logic, without resorting to using another logic, or else you lose the benefit of having logical relations between things in the first place
09/16 13:41:08<stoopkid> so especially for something like a "generalized" voice-controlled-computer that needs to relate vocabulary to all the concepts on the computer, you need to have a single logical framework in order to relate everything together
09/16 13:43:29<stoopkid> MLTT is machine-interpretable logic and adequately models basic human reasoning, with arbitrary computational capacity, i think it's a suitable logical framework for <insert anything you think you need logic for>
09/16 13:44:23<stoopkid> so, not to restrict what logic anybody wants to use for their semantics, but that's the one i'd choose for relating things together in my system
09/16 13:48:56<stoopkid> so, i think instead of having the logic and database be separate components, i think the logic should *be* a database
09/16 13:49:21<stoopkid> like, imagine if agda was a database rather than a "programming language"
09/16 13:50:54<stoopkid> so, we wouldn't force the full complexity of that on the user, we'd model a simpler kind of database within this agdabase system and let users play in that until they want to delve into the full complexity
09/16 13:51:46<sirdancealot> yea basically tau
09/16 13:52:23<stoopkid> mmm, maybe if we incorporated DHT and a nomic block-chain into it?
09/16 13:52:45<sirdancealot> shrug
09/16 13:53:13<stoopkid> it's the part of tau that i know how to build anyway :)
09/16 13:53:45<stoopkid> s/anyway/though/
09/16 13:53:58<sirdancealot> not the part that makes magic happen imho
09/16 13:55:20<stoopkid> depends what magic you're talking about
09/16 13:55:31<sirdancealot> yeah
09/16 13:55:47<stoopkid> you don't need tau to make all the logical magic happen
09/16 13:55:57<stoopkid> that's just MLTT
09/16 13:56:52<sirdancealot> i was thinking also of the rdf part
09/16 13:56:57<stoopkid> oh
09/16 13:57:46<stoopkid> yea it would be exactly like tau in that regard, a database of MLTT, possibly expressed as rdf like in tau, possibly not
09/16 13:57:57<stoopkid> i could go either way
09/16 13:58:50<stoopkid> rdf/n3 has it's upsides and it's downsides; i'm still undecided how i feel about it
09/16 14:00:21<stoopkid> i do think that triple/quad logic is maybe the way to go, especially because it corresponds nicely to a foundation for categories, but idk how i feel about the rdf/n3 languages for this in particular
09/16 14:00:53<stoopkid> maybe some kind of "purified" version of these
09/16 14:04:14<stoopkid> but yea, so you've got a system like tau's knowledge-base to store your knowledge-base of information on your computer, and use the logical part of it to relate the concepts together and to the vocabulary of your languages
09/16 14:06:24<stoopkid> you can then use this to impose constraints on your computer, make complex queries against it, and you've got a foundation that i think would be suitable for CNL, especially after the small experiments we've done trying to map CNL expressions into type theory where we saw natural correspondences between human CNL concepts and type theory concepts
09/16 14:07:27<stoopkid> "and", "or", "if blank then blank", "every blank blanks", "there is a blank such that blank"
09/16 14:08:54<stoopkid> then it's setting up a voice interface to that CNL and you've got a voice-controlled-computer, to whatever extent we've built up the logic and language-definitions
09/16 14:14:39<stoopkid> now, i could build a real simplified version of this with/into lemon
09/16 14:18:03<stoopkid> i see how to put together a rough draft of the "basic packaging", which would demonstrate how the different components are supposed to fit together and implement a real real primitive version of what the system could be if the rough draft were completed into a full version of the basic packaging, and this was then extended like it's meant to be
09/16 14:19:22<stoopkid> so here's how it would go, in my imagination:
09/16 14:19:47<stoopkid> we take lemon how it is now, it let's us define languages and then semantics for them right
09/16 14:21:49<stoopkid> so, we make a little database where you can stick all the languages you define, like our lambda languages, and with them we store different kinds of "standard" semantics related to them, like the parsers/interpreters we made for them
09/16 14:23:09<stoopkid> right now in lemon you've got the lemon parser parsing everything, i would modularize this, so that you can get these things from any source, as long as you can run them through the packaging
09/16 14:24:21<stoopkid> i.e. if you've got some parser, and you can store it in the database such that it can be used with some standard command like "parse", then you should be able to use that
09/16 14:25:26<stoopkid> so, i'd have the lemon language-definition-language separate from the database-of-languages-and-their-supporting-tools
09/16 14:25:58<stoopkid> the former is a tool to let us easily generate things we can put in the latter
09/16 14:27:10<stoopkid> i'd take the MLTT we built, finish it, and then split it up to be a database, like in tau
09/16 14:27:38<stoopkid> maybe using the rdf, maybe not, but definitely taking all the compiler ideas in either case
09/16 14:29:28<stoopkid> i'd use a standard procedure of expressing languages in MLTT to automatically map the CFG syntaxes you generate in lemon into an MLTT representation of the language, stored in the MLTT-base
09/16 14:29:48<stoopkid> from there you can do w/e you want with it to relate it to other concepts in the MLTT-base
09/16 14:30:36<stoopkid> then, i'd look at the expressions of MLTT, and come up with a basic CNL for it, like we already experimented with
09/16 14:31:05<stoopkid> idk if CFG would be able to express that CNL
09/16 14:31:48<stoopkid> if not, no matter, we can build whatever kind of parser we need into it if CFG isn't sufficient
09/16 14:34:11<stoopkid> after that i'm not sure what steps to take. this is the basic setup, but then to finish it off you'd need the voice-to-CNL and the simplified subset of the MLTT-base
09/16 14:35:39<stoopkid> really you only need the voice-to-CNL, and the simplified subset could be done later, since this is only a proof-of-concept
09/16 14:36:57<stoopkid> i don't necessarily know how to go about the voice-to-CNL though, that's something i'd have to do a lot of research towards
09/16 14:37:15<stoopkid> maybe if you covered that then that would complete the chain here
09/16 14:38:30<stoopkid> once we have that voice<->language<->logic<->knowledge, we've got a voice-controlled reasoner
09/16 14:38:55<stoopkid> then it's just a matter of opening up your computer's functionality to it through the shell, and you've got voice-controlled-computer
09/16 14:39:34<stoopkid> how exactly to go about opening it up... that's something we'd need to think about, but i think just the voice-controlled reasoner is a decent enough thing to start with
09/16 14:40:01<stoopkid> if we don't have the voice-controlled-reasoner we can't have a voice-controlled-computer
09/16 14:40:14<stoopkid> i just can't see how it can work otherwise
09/16 14:41:48<stoopkid> well, i should specify, "work" in any kind of capacity that we've discussed wanting it to work in
09/16 14:42:23<sirdancealot> for voice recognition id start with plugging in gf
09/16 14:42:35<sirdancealot> shrug, i dont need mltt to voice-control my computer, but whaetever
09/16 14:43:48<stoopkid> not mltt necessarily, but if you want your voice-control to include a capacity for reasoning then you have a system of reasoning, i.e. some system of logic
09/16 14:44:51<stoopkid> whatever you end up doing to handle the voice-control is implicitly defining some kind of system of reasoning about the things you're saying
09/16 14:45:19<sirdancealot> nope its implicitly the big bang
09/16 14:45:54* stoopkid shrugs
09/16 14:47:19<stoopkid> it's reasoning whether it's a dispatch table of simple voice commands or a full-fledged mathematical prover reasoning over complex sentences and situations
09/16 14:48:22<stoopkid> neither is any more valid than the other, you should be able to make both or w/e you want and store these languages and the semantics into the language-definitions-and-tools-database
09/16 14:49:37<stoopkid> that being said, the only system of reasoning i'm gonna be designing any CNL for is gonna be MLTT or some framework with similar semantics and the same capabilities
09/16 14:52:06<sirdancealot> alright
09/16 14:53:45<sirdancealot> so is there a way thru this to make it worth for you to participate?
09/16 14:53:58<stoopkid> after i build a CNL system based on MLTT i might try other kinds of ways to handle the CNL, but i'd definitely start with the one based on MLTT, if only because that's the only way i actually have any idea how to build one capable of decent CNL processing
09/16 14:54:22<stoopkid> to participate in what?
09/16 14:54:46<stoopkid> you mean is there a way to profit off of these ideas?
              <sirdancealot> in developing any aspect of lemon
09/16 14:54:56<sirdancealot> no
09/16 14:58:09<stoopkid> are you asking if building lemon into this stuff would make it worth it for me to participate in building lemon?
09/16 14:59:08<stoopkid> if so then yea definitely, that's why i'm detailing how i'd go about adding the pieces i have in mind :P
09/16 15:01:27<stoopkid> i think it's only worth it for anybody though if i only worked on the parts that i have a clear picture of; for example i don't have a clear picture of how to make a good language-definition language, or an editor for it, or editors for the languages you make with it, or how to handle voice-to-CNL, or set it up with a shell that actually interfaces to the
              <stoopkid> computer
09/16 15:02:23<stoopkid> and i haven't dedicated much thought to these, relative to what i have along the lines of logic databases, CNL and reverse-engineering
09/16 15:05:16<stoopkid> luckily though, you've been focusing on all those parts that i haven't
09/16 15:08:07<stoopkid> put together, we've got the whole thing covered, especially since i'll pick up on that stuff once i'm working in that context and seeing what's going on and how it should fit together with the logic-database, language-database & CNL
09/16 15:10:28<stoopkid> i don't think it would take us long at all to set up the logic-database and integrate it with the languages defined in lemon
09/16 15:11:22<stoopkid> we made 4 type theory / lambdas languages in two weeks, with theorem provers, and that was when we didn't know what we were doing :P
09/16 15:13:25<stoopkid> btw, are you ontologiae ?
09/16 15:14:18<sirdancealot> alright
09/16 15:14:19<sirdancealot> no
09/16 15:14:40<stoopkid> ah
09/16 15:19:48<stoopkid> alright, so, are you ok  with incorporating these features into it? i don't think it should interfere with anything you've been building with the language-definition-language or editors for it, just maybe modularize the implementation somewhat for storage in the database-of-languages
09/16 15:21:56<sirdancealot> yea ill be happy if we work on something again
09/16 15:22:28<sirdancealot> i dont know where or how to start tho
09/16 15:24:02<stoopkid> let's start with a proof-of-concept of the database of languages; that's where it all begins in my mind
09/16 15:25:05<stoopkid> we can get me into the editor by making the goal be to be able to use the editor like an IDE for any language in the database, using the menus to be able to switch out what language you're using and to execute commands or w/e
09/16 15:26:14<stoopkid> that is essentially what you had in mind with editor right?
09/16 15:27:49<sirdancealot> eventually yeah
09/16 15:28:56<stoopkid> alright cool. so, you mentioned earlier that you could immediately start building up the editor you want in qt
09/16 15:29:35<stoopkid> maybe we should build it up from the beginning in qt so we both learn a new language and go through the idea of what the editor should be together?
09/16 15:30:24<sirdancealot> sounds good, im just actually not sure about building it in c++, while the rest of stuff is in python
09/16 15:30:55<sirdancealot> and there are issues with using qt from python
09/16 15:32:22<sirdancealot> or nvm, i think its not really an issue that i'd have to give up my license for now
09/16 15:32:54<stoopkid> your pick, i'll be learning something new either way
09/16 15:33:41<stoopkid> so, yea, that's where i'd start is with the language-definitions database
09/16 15:34:07<stoopkid> so with that i'd start by making a list of standard supporting tools you'll find for a language
09/16 15:34:19<stoopkid> like, an interpreter, a compiler, a parser, etc..
09/16 15:35:30<stoopkid> and then we make standard ways for how you can call these kinds of tools on programs written in the languages
09/16 15:36:28<stoopkid> so, you somehow indicate to the database what a particular tool is, like for example the interpreters we built for the lambdas languages, we'd indicate that they're interpreters
09/16 15:37:12<stoopkid> doesn't matter whether the thing you're calling an interpreter is actually a valid interpreter or even a working program, you just need to be able to find all the things that are *supposed* to be interpreters, or compilers, or etc..
09/16 15:37:25<stoopkid> from the menu, in the editor
09/16 15:38:11<stoopkid> then there would be a standard calling convention for each of these, so that you can actually use them
09/16 15:38:55<stoopkid> and whether or not they work is up to the code of that particular program, we don't need to go overkill with verified parsers and interpreters and such just yet we're just making a proof-of-concept and an outline
09/16 15:41:23<stoopkid> alright so, there might be some tricky parts to this wrt storing the interpreter/compiler/parser programs in a database, but the idea is straight-forward enough and those are just tricky parts with the implementation
09/16 15:41:42<stoopkid> i don't think it's anything we can't handle after our jit compilers and such
09/16 15:42:24<stoopkid> and i may or may not be overthinking it, you might already see simple ways to handle it, idk
09/16 15:43:19<stoopkid> the shell we'd build up as an entirely separate component from all this
09/16 15:44:24<stoopkid> imo it's purpose should just be to interface to the system and integrate the other tools, i.e. the language-definitions-database, logic, etc..
09/16 15:45:17<stoopkid> the shell just exposes the system to the editors or the logic, etc..


09/16 15:47:52<sirdancealot> well as on the database, the current state of things is: lemon nodes serialized in json, bash scripts and data files laying around, plain text laying around or stuffed into lemon nodes serialized in json
09/16 15:49:04<sirdancealot> whats still missing is a triplestore and a system of projecting the concepts in it to nodes (more complex language) and back
09/16 15:52:54<editable-koo>the work has to be done at some point, just not sure when
09/16 15:53:17<stoopkid> yea i guess we don't need to change anything about how it's set up now in order to get a proof-of-concept
09/16 15:53:30<stoopkid> wrt language-definition-database
09/16 15:54:21<editable-koo>yeah, we can look at lemon modules as a database
09/16 15:55:59<stoopkid> alright so, i'd say there's multiple things still missing: logic system (triple-store), CNL prototype, voice-to-CNL, and shell
09/16 15:57:27<stoopkid> voice-to-CNL is dependent on CNL, and CNL is dependent on the logic system, as far as i'm concerned
09/16 15:58:00<stoopkid> shell is independent though, it simply exposes the system to the editors and logic
09/16 15:58:20<editable-koo>well, if you want to have a combined logic-system-triple-store is a question
09/16 15:59:13<stoopkid> why not, that's what we have in tau already, just without the extra MLTT goodness
09/16 16:00:08<editable-koo>we actually dont have a triplestore in tau, neither do we have an python orm in it
09/16 16:00:39<stoopkid> quad-store*
09/16 16:01:40<editable-koo>sept-store*
09/16 16:02:11<stoopkid> the only difference is that you actually need 4 to run the logic, you don't need 7
09/16 16:02:28<editable-koo>sex-store?
09/16 16:02:44<stoopkid> don't need 6 either, sounds fun though
09/16 16:03:01<editable-koo>pent-store
09/16 16:03:19<editable-koo>yea so
09/16 16:03:45<editable-koo>so, ive been listening to justin bieber last two days
09/16 16:03:59<stoopkid> that's never a good sign :P
09/16 16:04:47<editable-koo>i didnt know
09/16 16:06:06<stoopkid> so, triple-store/quad-store/MLTT, whatever it is, we want to map the complex concepts in it to vocabulary, we agree on that much
09/16 16:07:07<editable-koo>the whole playlist is kinda half-crappy, i dont know why ive kept it running apparently on repeat for past two days, but hey its not really bad at all
09/16 16:07:37<stoopkid> i've honestly never heard any of it, i'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people making fun of him heh
09/16 16:07:54<editable-koo>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK_0jXPuIr0
09/16 16:08:22<editable-koo>i suppose this doesnt get you the same autoplay playlist as to me so its out of context, but judge for yourself
09/16 16:09:11<editable-koo>theres this kind of new dance-pop that youtube keeps pushing on me, i dont think its great but i dont mind it either
09/16 16:09:40<editable-koo>it usually jumps to it from something else that i explicitly play
09/16 16:12:06<editable-koo>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyEuk8j8imI
09/16 16:12:09<editable-koo>not bad
09/16 16:13:05<editable-koo>there may be another aspect to this: if this was sung in czech, id prolly vomit right away
09/16 16:13:43<editable-koo>i dont find my ears can stand the same amount of primitivity of lyrics that english language somehow makes okay
09/16 16:15:06<stoopkid> lol
09/16 16:15:07<editable-koo>in czech music i look for wit and wordplay
09/16 16:15:30<editable-koo>in english i guess i mostly cant appreciate it even if i stumble upon it lol
09/16 16:16:32<stoopkid> you find a lot more of that in rap
09/16 16:18:30<editable-koo>im not well-versed in english language rap
09/16 16:18:56<editable-koo>ventured a bit into eminem the other week
09/16 16:19:44<stoopkid> do you know atmosphere?
09/16 16:21:33<editable-koo>nope..
09/16 16:22:54<stoopkid> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nMpsiVPQzU
09/16 16:27:08<stoopkid> or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXZgf9wq-IU
09/16 16:29:18<editable-koo>interesting
09/16 16:29:23<editable-koo>gotta go grab some food
09/16 16:29:56<stoopkid> and then you gotta know some biggie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN2VKL-4Pj4
09/16 16:33:07<stoopkid> let's see, where's the good eminem
09/16 16:33:15<stoopkid> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp0qv3NHrYE
09/16 16:45:42<stoopkid> binary star's pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLraLApzXO8
09/16 16:48:41<stoopkid> wu tang clan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIPfQ-HtYeM
09/16 16:50:57<stoopkid> mobb deep: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NUX4tW5pps
09/16 16:51:23<stoopkid> anyway, that's a good start to find the real shit
09/16 16:54:03<stoopkid> so, anyway, we'd build up some system where we're defining logic, triplestore/quadstore/MLTT-kb, and we want to map the concepts in this database to vocabulary
09/16 16:55:23<sirdancealot> ya brain damage
09/16 16:55:42<sirdancealot> atmosphere is simplish but not terrible
09/16 16:57:05<stoopkid> eminem's got some really good stuff i just can't remember what most of it's called
09/16 16:58:01<sirdancealot> ya he does
09/16 17:00:16<stoopkid> so, we'd have some work to do to figure out how a language made in lemon could reference a database of vocabulary
09/16 17:01:37<stoopkid> i.e. for a CNL extensible with vocabulary and it's meaning stored in a database, i.e. it's dictionary
09/16 17:02:19<stoopkid> well, for proof of concept maybe there wouldn't be quite so much work to do for that
09/16 17:03:02*** Quit: ontologiae (~ontologia@79.98.21.80) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 265 seconds
09/16 17:04:04<stoopkid> so, if you were gonna set up GF for the voice-to-code, then the logical framework might as well be MLTT since GF is based on dependent type theory
09/16 17:06:59<stoopkid> whatever other thing you might want to work in, like pure triple store or w/e, can be recovered from MLTT, i.e. we can take a restricted subset of MLTT that only let's you build objects in a triple-store type
09/16 17:07:35<stoopkid> so, nothing lost there, the full MLTT is just available
09/16 17:07:59<stoopkid> and it'll need to be because the CNL i'd define is based on it
09/16 17:10:24<stoopkid> so, i'd start with a basic CNL that's essentially just a 1:1 translation of type theory into english
09/16 17:10:45<stoopkid> or into some abstract syntax and then into the concrete syntax english
09/16 17:11:36<stoopkid> so, then we'd get the voice-to-CNL set up, and we'd have voice-controlled-reasoner
09/16 17:12:25<stoopkid> parallel to this, we have the shell, which exposes the computer to the rest of the system
09/16 17:14:08<stoopkid> when both are complete, the concepts defining the exposed computer can be mapped into the logic, and the voice-controlled-reasoner can be made to operate over this data, and effect it, thereby giving full system control to the user
09/16 17:14:33<stoopkid> affect*
09/16 17:16:40<stoopkid> the  languages in the database of languages can be applied to the data exposed by the shell in order to view it better, like you want to disassemble some binary into a language you define, or you want to open up the file, select parts of it and decompile them in different ways
09/16 17:17:37<stoopkid> thus the combination of shell + language-definition-language + language-definition-database + general editor over this makes for a pretty fancy dev & reverse-engineering tool-set
09/16 17:17:59<stoopkid> and then if you throw the logic in there you can do even fancier reverse-engineering and debugging, using automated logic
09/16 17:19:23<stoopkid> spread code out over a database so that you can do look-ups against it, all kinds of stuff
09/16 17:19:39<stoopkid> over the* database
09/16 17:20:03<stoopkid> this is more or less what i've got in mind, how do you feel about it?
09/16 17:25:59<stoopkid> btw we can just simply use GF as the logic for the proof-of-concept, since it's a dependent type theory system so i can easily base a functioning CNL off of it
09/16 17:31:45<stoopkid> so, this whole thing with disassembling binaries and decompiling assembly or data, seeing a layered view through the compilation, which is indexed to find what parts in one map to what parts in the other, and why, is part of my dream dev/reverse-engineering toolkit
09/16 17:32:39<sirdancealot> sounds alright
09/16 17:34:18<stoopkid> cool, so, i'm thinking that to get full system control, we model our ISAs as langs with lemon, and describe them in the logic
09/16 17:34:43<stoopkid> they're simple languages, and this has us jumping immediately to full system control
09/16 17:35:23<stoopkid> then it's "just" a matter of building over top of that and simplifying back to the high-level view of the system we typically work with
09/16 17:36:58<stoopkid> seem reasonable?
09/16 17:37:43<sirdancealot> kinda
09/16 17:38:23<stoopkid> anything seem unreasonable?
09/16 17:38:41<sirdancealot> not yet
09/16 17:42:18<stoopkid> alright, so, that's my full plan at this point. i guess if the first step is to get the logic component integrated into it then i'd say that means integrating GF into it, for the proof-of-concept
09/16 17:42:52<stoopkid> it'll mimic an MLTT database until we need an actual one
09/16 17:43:23<stoopkid> and let's us jump into voice-to-CNL (and CNL design generally) much quicker
09/16 17:45:19<sirdancealot> sorry i think im gonna nap
09/16 17:45:24<stoopkid> np
09/16 17:46:50<stoopkid> so, GF would serve the dual purpose of acting as a logic database and an extension of the language-definition system beyond CFG
09/16 17:47:55<sirdancealot> i dont think you can make it act as a database
09/16 17:48:23<stoopkid> we can make it act as a proof-of-concept of what a database of it could do though, that's all i mean
09/16 17:48:45<sirdancealot> dunno
09/16 17:51:32<stoopkid> a database of it would just be splitting up it's different terms into records in persistent storage, so, an agda or GF file is already acting as a form of database that just isn't built to scale to a database's needs
09/16 17:53:13<stoopkid> they're built to run programs defined with terms, not run databases defined with terms, but that's effectively the only difference
09/16 17:54:17<stoopkid> like in tau's design, it's more database than program, or intended to be
09/16 17:54:26<stoopkid> same thing here, that's all it is
09/16 17:56:06<stoopkid> so, an agda/GF file works just as well, it's just limited in scalability
09/16 17:56:57<stoopkid> we'd go with GF ofc, since that's got the support for CNL to get us right on track to finish up the proof-of-concept without an excruciating amount of effort
09/16 17:58:13<stoopkid> so, ultimately GF will become just an extension of the language-definition system, but for the proof-of-concept it can serve as the database
09/16 17:59:03<stoopkid> and if it can't for some reason (like inability to lookup terms, like you can in agda), then we'd use agda instead, and i'd incorporate the relevant features from GF into agda
09/16 18:00:04<stoopkid> or maybe a reworking of tau's system to incorporate the MLTT
09/16 18:00:17<stoopkid> yea probably that rather than agda since agda just gets us off track
09/16 18:00:33<stoopkid> but this only if GF can't work even for a proof-of-concept for some reason
09/16 18:01:56<stoopkid> for exposing the computer through the shell, idk, you've got a lot more experience there than i do
09/16 18:03:30<stoopkid> once it's exposed i can tell you how to manipulate it, but it would take me some effort to figure out how to expose the system on a level that matches the ISA logic
09/16 18:03:53<stoopkid> (the ISA logic that gets encoded into the logical framework, i mean)
09/16 18:06:32<stoopkid> so, i think to split that up, we both study the ISAs, but you focus on exposing them through the shell, and i focus on modeling them in the logic and receiving the exposed data into it
09/16 18:08:56<stoopkid> it's a lot, but the idea is that this system would allow us to extend more whenever we need it
09/16 18:15:58<stoopkid> anyway, we don't actually need to do the whole ISA thing for the proof of concept and actually run our computers, we can use an extremely simplified ISA with just a couple instructions and an extremely simplified model of a computer, and show how you can tell the computer to do things with it or ask the computer questions about it, and that the logical
              <stoopkid> framework actually allows it to reason out an answer, or figure out how to do something, all by voice commands
09/16 18:17:17<stoopkid> so, i could just model a simple computer with a simple instruction set and a shell for it within the logic, and we could use that to demonstrate the proof-of-concept
09/16 18:18:33<stoopkid> ok, so, this gets back to "why modularize it all", especially with the language-definitions-and-supporting-tools part
09/16 18:19:30<stoopkid> we want to be able to use this as a shell and get all these nice features like plugging in support for new languages and interpreting data with the languages into the logic
09/16 18:19:37<stoopkid> and we want to be able to do it with our actual computers
09/16 18:21:04<stoopkid> but our actual computers are really complex beasts, with layers and layers of languages and structures upon structures of components
09/16 18:25:35<stoopkid> we can certainly define some new language support when we're doing some reverse engineering of some code/data, and that's extremely useful, and something i definitely want out of this, but for this to ever scale up to something where we're examining and operating our computers with it,  we need to be able to plug in existing supporting tools for languages
09/16 18:28:02<stoopkid> that doesn't get those tools into the level of the logic, but it integrates them into the system for standard development, debugging and reverse-engineering
09/16 18:29:09<stoopkid> the logic describing all these things has to get built up over time. there's no way around it; for the logic to reason about these things, their theories must be described, and their theories are not currently described in terms of this logic
09/16 18:44:05<stoopkid> "how many partitions does my hard-drive have?"
09/16 20:35:59<stoopkid> so i guess for plugging in existing tools, we'll want to define APIs for the various types of tools, and then for each tool we can write scripts that run it under this API, so that it's use is accessible to the rest of the lemon system
09/16 20:39:07<stoopkid> so, for example, we might want to add gcc to it to compile our C language definition; so we use the API to interface to gcc, i.e. run it with some command line, for example
09/16 20:43:59<stoopkid> ok, so, cool
09/16 20:44:23<stoopkid> looks like it's a pretty sure thing that i'll be able to get some web dev work from my neighbor
09/16 20:45:54<stoopkid> and my dad's pushing me to do this so he'll understand if the timeframe it takes me to start making any money from it doesnt quite match with the timeframes they originally gave me to start paying rent
09/16 20:49:46<stoopkid> so, i'm starting to wonder if there's a correspondence between types and languages
09/16 20:50:09<stoopkid> there's a correspondence between types and categories, and a correspondence between categories and languages..
09/16 20:50:33<stoopkid> Data Nat = Zero | S Nat
09/16 20:50:41<stoopkid> seems like a CFG
09/16 20:51:46<stoopkid> especially when you consider that files/programs/data can be said to have a language and also can be said to have a type
09/16 20:51:57<stoopkid> and the language and the type don't seem to be particularly distinct
09/16 20:52:11<stoopkid> for example, consider the linux executable file format
09/16 20:52:28<stoopkid> it's got some file headers and such defining it as an executable
09/16 20:53:23<stoopkid> if you look at the headers, you could describe their contents, as some kind of language of data values, or some kind of type of data values, there's not much difference
09/16 20:54:48<stoopkid> there's only really a reason for a distinction when you consider a language that itself has types
09/16 20:55:28<stoopkid> but even then, the distinction seems to me to be probably artificial
09/16 20:56:53<stoopkid> take one of our CFGs
09/16 20:56:59<stoopkid> any of them
09/16 20:57:07<stoopkid> it makes an inductive type right?
09/16 20:57:33<stoopkid> this inductive type is the syntax of our language
09/16 21:02:17<stoopkid> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus#Syntax
09/16 21:02:44<stoopkid> Data BaseTypes = Int | Nat | String | Bool | ...
09/16 21:03:28<stoopkid> Data Type = BaseType | Type -> Type
09/16 21:06:25<stoopkid> Data Var = V VarIndex
09/16 21:06:55<stoopkid> Data VarIndex = VZero | VSuc VarIndex
09/16 21:08:15<sirdancealot> youre starting to wonder? i thought you were sure about this
09/16 21:08:21<sirdancealot> always affirming that i wasnt crazy
09/16 21:09:47<stoopkid> i mean a stronger / more direct correspondence than "type theory would be a good basis for the logic of a CNL"
09/16 21:10:09<stoopkid> and strong / more direct than "you can model languages in type theory"
09/16 21:10:13<stoopkid> stronger*
09/16 21:10:39<stoopkid> which is all the correspondence i've been going off of, which is still good enough for me
09/16 21:10:45<sirdancealot> hmm
09/16 21:11:31<stoopkid> so, i knew that languages corresponded to types, but what hadn't occurred to me until i said "i'm starting to wonder..." is that you might be able to say the reverse, that types correspond to languages
09/16 21:12:51<stoopkid> so this seems to reaffirm to me that modeling a language as a type in type theory isn't an iffy or radically experimental construction, it's following a fairly natural correspondence
09/16 21:13:48<sirdancealot> i really think we did go over this correspondences before
09/16 21:14:05<stoopkid> possibly
09/16 21:14:51<sirdancealot> what ive been doing in newshit is the other way around, language becomes a type system
09/16 21:15:41<sirdancealot> doesnt matter
09/16 21:17:21<stoopkid> so, wrt database, consider:
09/16 21:17:43<stoopkid> Data Person = stoopkid | sirdancealot | HMC | ...
09/16 21:19:12<sirdancealot> im not sure HMC subclasses from Human
09/16 21:19:28<stoopkid> touche
09/16 21:21:10<stoopkid> in any case, we could expand these data types to essentially be like relational database tables, like Data Person = Row1 | Row2 | ...
09/16 21:21:30<sirdancealot> why
09/16 21:22:15<stoopkid> i'm just saying you could. we can expand them into essentially any kind of database
09/16 21:22:21<sirdancealot> does this seem a better db to you than linked data?
09/16 21:22:37<stoopkid> yes
09/16 21:22:43<sirdancealot> why
09/16 21:23:57<stoopkid> where in linked data do you find any of this logical reasoning capacity?
09/16 21:24:12<sirdancealot> what reasoning?
09/16 21:24:43<stoopkid> any of it
09/16 21:25:19<stoopkid> i don't have ideas for how to build CNL over linked data, i do have ideas for how to build it over type theory though
09/16 21:25:41<stoopkid> because of the logical reasoning capacity
09/16 21:25:47<sirdancealot> what any?
09/16 21:26:22<sirdancealot> you mean mltt?
09/16 21:26:39<stoopkid> yes
09/16 21:27:18<stoopkid> this would be a martin-lof type theory database
09/16 21:29:51<stoopkid> so, consider an agda file which is like a program vs. tau's system which is like a db
09/16 21:30:02<stoopkid> we'd be like tau's db
09/16 21:30:46<stoopkid> we'd expand the programs (databases), index them, provide query support over them, and make them scalable like a db
09/16 21:31:23<stoopkid> in pretty much the same way that we do in tau, down to how the implementation works
09/16 21:32:25<stoopkid> o
09/16 21:33:34<stoopkid> ** i'm just pointing out that "Person a Type. stoopkid a Person. koo a Person. HMC a Person. ..." is the same as "Data Person = stoopkid | koo | HMC | .. "
09/16 21:36:32<stoopkid> ok so. how straightforward is it to hook voice to GF?
09/16 21:37:45<sirdancealot> pretty straightforward, apparently
09/16 21:39:36<sirdancealot> on what level should be the data in the db, lambda terms or more abstract?
09/16 21:40:24<stoopkid> i guess technically more abstract; they'd be the objects in these inductive types, or proofs of other types, sometimes lambda terms
09/16 21:41:03<stoopkid> think how you put a field type on a table in a relational database
09/16 21:41:41<sirdancealot> i really dont know what putting a field type on a table means
09/16 21:41:59<stoopkid> have you ever used SQL?
09/16 21:42:03<sirdancealot> yes
09/16 21:42:25<stoopkid> err, column* type
09/16 21:43:09<stoopkid> think of the product of column types, that defines essentially the record type defining that table, right
09/16 21:43:16<stoopkid> i.e. it's the type of the records (rows) in that table
09/16 21:43:37<stoopkid> except now instead of simple SQL record types we have general MLTT types
09/16 21:44:11<sirdancealot> shrug
09/16 21:44:40* stoopkid shrugs
09/16 21:45:56<stoopkid> you don't have to be impressed you just have to accept that i don't know any other way to make the fancy stuff work without making it totally ad hoc
09/16 21:46:09<stoopkid> (totally ad hoc and probably non-working)
09/16 21:47:20<stoopkid> i'm not saying it can't be done other ways, i'm sure it can, i'm just saying that *i* don't know how
09/16 21:49:07<stoopkid> just even the basic thing for voice-control, the CNL, i don't know how to make one that's actually suitable for giving complex commands or asking complex questions without using a type theory system
09/16 21:50:10<stoopkid> not just a type theory system but a type theory system split up into a database that can grow as new vocabulary and concepts are put into it
09/16 21:53:24<stoopkid> anyway, i don't really see any way that using an MLTT database limits or interferes with anything else in the system or even any way that it changes much of how things are expressed if you express them in the MLTT, it simply expands the system's logical capacity out to the full logical capacity it's "supposed" to have
09/16 21:54:46<stoopkid> just to emphasize this point, let's look at what GF is: a framework for describing CNL using dependent type theory
09/16 21:55:54* stoopkid shrugs
09/16 21:56:57<stoopkid> i don't think it can do any proper CNL without logical reasoning over a database of logical concepts, and i don't see any reason why that choice of logical reasoning framework wouldn't be MLTT
09/16 21:58:28<stoopkid> unless it was some variant that we decided was better for some reason, like a category-theoretical formulation of it, or HoTT
09/16 21:58:57<stoopkid> like, there's things that are a substitute for it, but it's not just linked data
09/16 22:00:23<stoopkid> "not", "and", "or", "implies", "forall", "there exists" <-- it needs logic, because humans speak in logic
09/16 22:00:35<stoopkid> and humans think in logic, and all math and reasoning is done in logic
09/16 22:01:29<stoopkid> if you have these things, and you implemented them appropriately, then you're back to a system of dependent type theory
09/16 22:01:52<stoopkid> if you're missing any one of these things i'll be like ??
09/16 22:02:42<sirdancealot> yea np
09/16 22:11:06<stoopkid> so wrt whether everything would be in lambdas or not; implicitly they would be but for example Data Bool = True | False isn't terrible lambdas, and variables of type Bool can compile down to bits
09/16 22:14:24<sirdancealot> terrible lambdas?
09/16 22:14:39<sirdancealot> so, no triplestore, not even a quadstore?
09/16 22:16:21<stoopkid> we could implement this in a quad store and then we have quad store + MLTT
09/16 22:17:18<sirdancealot> i dont think we should have both for the sake of it
09/16 22:18:09<stoopkid> then i'd have MLTT for the sake of it
09/16 22:21:02<stoopkid> maybe if it was a quadstore that was capable of logic with "not", "and", "or", "implies", "exists", and "forall", but then that would just be quadstore + MLTT again
09/16 22:22:24<sirdancealot> so what did you mean terrible lambdas?
09/16 22:22:50<stoopkid> i meant http://augustss.blogspot.com/2007/11
09/16 22:23:00<stoopkid> vs. Data Bool = True | False
09/16 22:23:24<stoopkid> terrible church-encodings*
09/16 22:25:06<sirdancealot>  you mean not that bad?
09/16 22:26:08<stoopkid> yea, Data Bool = True | False isn't nearly as bad as the church-encoding
09/16 22:27:00<sirdancealot> so youre saying we wont use lambdas here but something like TypeDeclaration?
09/16 22:28:03<sirdancealot> and Let?
09/16 22:28:38<stoopkid> yea we won't use lambdas to express our types through church-encodings, we'll just use these "inductive data types", and we won't use lambdas explicitly except for when we're actually talking about making a function
09/16 22:28:57<sirdancealot> ok
09/16 22:29:00<stoopkid> this is how it is in, say, agda, idris, haskell, etc...
09/16 22:30:07<stoopkid> so, we can always *interpret* these values as the church-encodings, but we don't ever have to write, store or manipulate them that way, until we specifically ask to check out the church-encoding
09/16 22:31:18<stoopkid> which would just be like, something you'd do in the editor, out of curiosity, maybe for a sanity check of some aspect of your code, idk, but we wouldn't  be coding in church-encodings at all, generally
09/16 22:32:21<stoopkid> so, the syntax of the language also doesn't have to be anything like agda, idris, haskell, etc..
09/16 22:32:45<stoopkid> i don't really care what the language is as much as i care that it maps to the right logic

09/18 13:36:32<stoopkid> also in the Projects section
09/18 13:37:38<stoopkid> i was wondering how we were gonna do the initial CNL, but no need:
 http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html
09/18 13:38:24<stoopkid> no need to roll it ourselves, i mean

09/18 17:48:17<stoopkid> i'm installing GF now then i'm gonna try some of the speech recognition systems
09/18 18:20:03<stoopkid> hrm, having some trouble getting it installed
09/18 18:20:37<stoopkid> or, at least it says it installed but the command "gf" doesn't work and i can't find whatever bin files it's supposed to be associated to
09/18 18:22:17<stoopkid> apparently we can use it from python somehow i'm still trying to figure out how to set that up though
09/18 19:04:29<stoopkid> alright i've got it set up and displaying parse-trees of the "Hello" grammar in graphviz
09/18 19:07:18<stoopkid> alright so i guess i should go through their tutorial and then dig into the standard library and get familiar with their english lib
09/18 19:18:11<stoopkid> so, i don't think we can do the full CNL in GF
09/18 19:18:29<stoopkid> well, lemme rephrase, i'm not sure if we can
09/18 19:19:26<stoopkid> depends on whether GF has enough support to step outside of dependent type theory and do arbitrary computation so that we can actually express the full type theory within the language
09/18 19:21:15<stoopkid> if it can't, then i think we'll ultimately have to roll our own dependent type theory system with an extralogical CNL syntax, since we can't model the full type theory as an object within the type theory without the MLTT self-interpreter
09/18 19:27:22<stoopkid> actually, we did the whole syntax in CFG, so it's definitely powerful enough to parse it's own syntax
09/18 19:31:20<stoopkid> so, then what would be necessary.. it would need to be able to map that syntax into the appropriate types
09/18 19:31:25<stoopkid> and terms
09/18 19:35:24<sirdancealot> storyboarding the ux...i have something better, a working proof of concept

09/18 19:39:21<sirdancealot> why?
09/18 19:39:53<sirdancealot> projects section is more interesting..
09/18 19:43:06<stoopkid> idk, simpler & more specific functionality, for standard prog-langs
09/18 19:46:22<stoopkid> hrm, what we could do is just use GF to handle parsing for the lang, since we know that MLTT can theoretically be expressed in just CFG, which is definitely within the capacity of GF
09/18 19:46:38<stoopkid> err, not just theoretically, we've done it, i meant hypothetically
09/18 19:48:32<editable-koo>yea, GF is for parsing, i think thats the idea
09/18 19:49:09<editable-koo>im tired...but keep it up
09/18 19:52:09<stoopkid> hrm, so i guess maybe we should have GF just for parsing and then maybe we'd want to map parse-trees into another MLTT lang like agda/idris that can handle their type-checking & compilation
09/18 19:55:38<stoopkid> problem is this doesn't have either the CNL or the MLTT hooked up to anything extensible like a database
09/18 19:57:38<editable-koo>what is "the CNL"?
09/18 19:58:21<stoopkid> the CNL that we'd use for the voice-control
09/18 19:58:40<stoopkid> just the language structures, as opposed to logic structures
09/18 19:59:06<sirdancealot> still no clue
09/18 19:59:56<stoopkid> about what
09/18 20:00:05<sirdancealot> what you mean
09/18 20:01:07<stoopkid> CNL built in GF provides the syntax, logical constructions in MLTT provide the semantics
09/18 20:04:19<stoopkid> idk, does that make sense?
09/18 20:04:46<sirdancealot> no
09/18 20:05:01<stoopkid> what doesn't make sense
09/18 20:05:41<sirdancealot> for example, i sometimes speak of a language definition language or of lemon language in general
09/18 20:05:47<sirdancealot> or of the mltt lc
09/18 20:05:52<sirdancealot> or of narsese
09/18 20:06:12<sirdancealot> what are you speaking of?
09/18 20:06:44<stoopkid> a controlled natural language that you could actually use for a voice-controlled computer
09/18 20:07:57<sirdancealot> do you have a concrete vision of the language?
09/18 20:08:27<stoopkid> for a proof-of-concept it would basically just be a clunky 1:1 mapping of a simplified MLTT into english
09/18 20:09:24<stoopkid> like those examples we were working out a couple months ago
09/18 20:09:39<sirdancealot> ok so lets call it mltt cnl?
09/18 20:09:53<stoopkid> sure
09/18 20:11:04<sirdancealot> now, what is "extensible like a database"?
09/18 20:12:00<stoopkid> like remember how i showed you how an agda program can be interpreted like a database
09/18 20:12:45<sirdancealot> well, its kind of a stretch to say it can
09/18 20:12:46<stoopkid> except that there's little to no capacity to use it like a database in terms of CRUD and it's not really scalable along those lines
09/18 20:13:28<sirdancealot> it can be interpreted as a set of definitions
09/18 20:14:00<stoopkid> right, it's got all the stuff that would be put into a database but it's not a database it's a prog-lang/prover
09/18 20:14:20<sirdancealot> yea ok
09/18 20:20:21<stoopkid> so, ultimately we'd want something more like a database. i'm not even sure how well we'd do just for a PoC with just something like agda. apparently isabelle is an MLTT system that's more like a db
09/18 20:21:17<stoopkid> maybe
09/18 20:21:20<stoopkid> i might be wrong about that
09/18 20:21:49<stoopkid> could be implemented with a relational db though
09/18 20:22:50<stoopkid> types would be tables, objects would be records in the tables, we'd use something like agda's type-checker to type-check rather than use the relational db's column types
09/18 20:23:21<stoopkid> or the same general idea but with a quad-store
09/18 20:23:47<sirdancealot> quad-store sounds much saner
09/18 20:24:10<sirdancealot> still not sure what exactly is your usecase with the db
09/18 20:24:36<stoopkid> that's where concepts & their vocab gets stored
09/18 20:24:45<sirdancealot> like, adding stuff to it, querying against it
09/18 20:24:58<stoopkid> right
09/18 20:25:58<sirdancealot> newshit has this role filled by modules, you could say
09/18 20:26:02<sirdancealot> or how to put it better
09/18 20:26:22<sirdancealot> you can add a module, add stuff to a module, use stuff from a module
09/18 20:28:01<stoopkid> basically how i'm imagining it is that questions expressed in the CNL would end up as propositions/types and the proving process would be invoked
09/18 20:29:23<sirdancealot> i can trivially set this up
09/18 20:29:44<stoopkid> cool :)
09/18 20:30:37<stoopkid> so, that's not really where the database aspect would come in, that would come in when you wanna say things like "koo is a person"
09/18 20:32:32<sirdancealot> ultimately its an ui issue
09/18 20:32:43<sirdancealot> in the normal world we have repls and we have files
09/18 20:33:37<sirdancealot> there may be something in between, and something entirely different, some "chat with your computer" kind of modality, dunno
09/18 20:33:48<sirdancealot> but i think these are all just different ui modalities to explore
09/18 20:35:16<stoopkid> sure
09/18 20:35:46<sirdancealot> some may be implemented by creating a superset of the language itself
09/18 20:36:02<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
09/18 20:36:03<sirdancealot> like, "add <x>, query <x>..
09/18 20:36:21<sirdancealot> where x is some mltt for example
09/18 20:38:17<stoopkid> yea that's basically how i'm imagining it, you get a really simple sub-lang that lets you control mltt a really simple sub-lang that *is* mltt, and then whatever you add to the database can extend this into a more complete CNL which has ability for complex propositions to be automatically answered about it
09/18 20:39:10<sirdancealot> ok cool, glad we got this sorted out
09/18 20:39:38<stoopkid> same, so does this make sense? are you alright with this design?
09/18 20:40:04<sirdancealot> sure
09/18 20:41:56<stoopkid> so, i'd imagine that this database would also correspond to that "organize everything" database we were talking about
09/18 20:42:02<stoopkid> ultimately
09/18 20:42:20<stoopkid> you organize everything, and then you can talk about it
09/18 20:42:28<sirdancealot> yea
09/18 20:43:21<stoopkid> so, would you agree this seems doable? at least a basic PoC
09/18 20:43:42<stoopkid> not necessarily including the "organize everything db"
09/18 20:45:25<sirdancealot> what i have in newshit is: there is a module, that has lines where you can add definitions and stuff
09/18 20:45:47<sirdancealot> now, a bit below it you can have a "repl" kind of module, or you can think of the module as a repl
09/18 20:46:02<sirdancealot> currently F7 evaluates current line
09/18 20:46:21<sirdancealot> the repl module has the definitions of the first module visible in its scope
09/18 20:46:41<sirdancealot> this pretty much is it, the simplest implementation
09/18 20:47:04<sirdancealot> we could extend the repl language with those "add" and "query"
09/18 20:47:36<sirdancealot> we could make it behave more repl-ish and evaluate upon pressing return
09/18 20:47:58<sirdancealot> we can reimplement this concept in a cli ui one way or another
09/18 20:48:20<stoopkid> so is the add persistent or non-persistent? (doesn't really matter for PoC, just curious)
09/18 20:48:47<sirdancealot> the add is made persistent by pressing ctrl-s
09/18 20:49:23<stoopkid> sounds logical :)
09/18 20:50:41<stoopkid> k so. could we use this for adding MLTT types & terms to the MLTT we built?
09/18 20:57:38<sirdancealot> yes we can use this for the mltt language we build
09/18 20:57:50<sirdancealot> built
09/18 21:00:15<stoopkid> ok cool, so, that lets us add more logical concepts. still have the problem though that the vocab doesn't make it back into the CNL in GF
09/18 21:02:36<sirdancealot> well, we need a variation on the integration of marpa into newshit
09/18 21:05:04<stoopkid> what kind of variation?
09/18 21:11:42<sirdancealot> in newshit, grammar is generated for the current cursor position
09/18 21:11:50<sirdancealot> based on static scope
09/18 21:16:55<stoopkid> hrm, not sure what you mean; that's not how we did the mltt grammar
09/18 21:18:11<sirdancealot> you never saw it in the gui
09/18 21:20:53<stoopkid> i guess i need to set up the gui here and check that out
09/18 21:21:21<sirdancealot> yeah that could help
09/18 21:28:41<sirdancealot> we did it, in the sense that we built up a module containing mltt language definitions, then created another module that had the first module in scope, then the cli took some text input and pasted it into a Parser in the second module and called parse()
09/18 21:28:44<sirdancealot> see cli.py
09/18 21:30:13<sirdancealot> m.collect_grammar(scope,...)
09/18 21:31:21<stoopkid> i see
09/18 21:33:09<sirdancealot> so, i can do the same with gf
09/18 21:34:47<sirdancealot> although this is essentially a hack extending the CFGness provided by marpa and it gets uply..
09/18 21:36:16<stoopkid> alright i'm running the lemon operating language
09/18 21:36:54<sirdancealot> lol
09/18 21:41:14<stoopkid> how we'd basically just reparse with GF each time we add something?
09/18 21:48:28<stoopkid> s/how/so/
09/18 21:51:23<stoopkid> that's fine for PoC, but it's also why we'd eventually want something like an actual database
09/18 21:52:24<sirdancealot> what does an actual database solve?
09/18 21:52:29<sirdancealot> reparse what?
09/18 21:55:20<stoopkid> like we need to be able to add vocabulary
09/18 21:56:05<sirdancealot> you mean we re-generate the grammar each time we add something?
09/18 21:56:13<stoopkid> right
09/18 21:58:22<sirdancealot> lets first consider what lets say python does
09/18 21:58:31<sirdancealot> for i in bananas: print(i)
09/18 21:59:54<sirdancealot> the grammar is: for <identifier> in <expression>: <statement>
09/18 22:00:01<sirdancealot> function call is a statement
09/18 22:00:18<sirdancealot> <identifier>(<expression>) is a function call
09/18 22:01:32<sirdancealot> identifier is a sequence of characters without space
09/18 22:03:31<sirdancealot> first theres a parsing phase, next there is a phase where identifiers are looked up (at run time, but doesnt matter)
09/18 22:05:58<sirdancealot> i wonder if this process would allow spaces in idenfiers
09/18 22:08:04<stoopkid> i gotta run for a bit but i'll read when i get back
09/18 22:08:08<sirdancealot> now, i have a more free system where anything can serve as an identifier
09/18 22:08:37<sirdancealot> so, the grammar is ambiguous
09/18 22:11:46<sirdancealot> so, one option i see is that my grammar would be similar to above, and i end up with a parse forest every time
09/18 22:13:11<sirdancealot> then have a phase that cleans that up, guessing something along the lines that a for loop with a loop variable that's later printed is more probable than a long two-line identifier
09/18 22:13:56<sirdancealot> the option i chose is that my grammar doesnt say that <identifier>(<expression>) is a function call
09/18 22:14:51<sirdancealot> instead the grammar is generated for the exact spot after the ":" and contains the rule that "print(" < experssion> ")" is a function call
09/18 22:15:19<sirdancealot> because it saw the print defun in scope
09/18 22:17:06<sirdancealot> i havent even fully implemented this yet and i think i could see some problems with it, but w/e
09/18 22:17:27<sirdancealot> now, your idea probably is that this all is handled in the code for the grammar, inside gf
09/18 22:17:55<sirdancealot> again we dont know how well or for what cases this is gonna work
09/18 22:24:08<sirdancealot>  so..i hope we eventually learn ..
09/18 22:25:41<sirdancealot> not sure what your idea of a solution involving a real db is
09/18 22:30:05<sirdancealot> ofc i want a real db, my idea is that such db will store lemon nodes, but im open to different ways
09/18 22:31:36<sirdancealot> and my idea is a triplestore, because i know that ill be able to query it in different ways, have data and metadata,
09/18 22:31:57<sirdancealot> i guess metadata is something i dont see how would work if our db was a tree of mltt nodes
09/19 00:38:34<stoopkid> ah
09/19 00:38:51<stoopkid> we'd need at least some of it to be outside of mltt
09/19 00:39:43<stoopkid> well, maybe; depends what you mean
09/19 00:39:54<stoopkid> you can have data and metadata in mltt too
09/19 00:40:07<stoopkid> metadata is just data about some other data
09/19 00:43:39<stoopkid> wrt database, we don't want to have to recompile all the knowledge encoded in MLTT every time we add/change some information
09/19 00:45:14<stoopkid> like if we had agda files where all the knowledge was encoded into MLTT, we'd have to compile it in order to make it usable in some way
09/19 00:46:04<stoopkid> we don't want to have recompile the whole thing, we only want to recompile the pieces that are affected by a change
09/19 00:46:23<stoopkid> like a database; only the parts that are affected even have to be considered during an update
09/19 00:47:23<stoopkid> that's one piece. next is scalability. there's a huge amount of vocabulary and concepts, at the very least we'll end up wanting to index this in various ways
09/19 00:48:29<stoopkid> plus we'll want to use the database for other things, sticking other kinds of information into it; we want to be able to attach vocabulary to these things and then have that become usable in the CNL
09/19 00:49:05<stoopkid> i really think MLTT-database would be useful by itself
09/19 00:49:27<stoopkid> it's a worthy product by itself; consider it an evolution beyond graph-db & linked data
09/19 00:51:48<stoopkid> consider that there's not many databases that can store functions, proofs, propositions, objects of abstract algebra, etc..
09/19 00:51:52<stoopkid> (if any?)
09/19 00:54:10<stoopkid> anyway, i'm flexible as to how this actually ends up getting stored
09/19 00:54:18<stoopkid> "i guess metadata is something i dont see how would work if our db was a tree of mltt nodes"
09/19 00:55:01<stoopkid> i don't see why you couldn't add extra information in there as long as you can extract just the mltt structure back out of it
09/19 00:57:51<stoopkid> ah, i see what you mean
09/19 00:58:05<stoopkid> if you metadata outside of mltt you can't use mltt to query it, sure
09/19 00:58:14<stoopkid> if you have*
09/19 00:59:25<stoopkid> so, my ultimate suggestion here would be to find a way to model both your data and your metadata in mltt
09/19 00:59:56<stoopkid> then both your data and metadata can be talked about by the same CNL we build for MLTT
09/19 01:00:38<stoopkid> if you want to put your metadata outside of MLTT, and still have it talked about by CNL, we mostly likely end up with a pretty schizo language
09/19 01:01:03<stoopkid> one way to handle this would just be to make it a different language to talk about the triple stores
09/19 01:01:29<stoopkid> or perhaps make a basic language that's interoperable with both the MLTT-CNL and the triple-store-CNL
09/19 01:01:57<stoopkid> now, this gets into something i was thinking about but didn't want to get into yet because... complicated..
09/19 01:03:17<stoopkid> humans don't just understand one CNL, we understand any lang we're taught to interpret, and we can mix them together to express concepts
09/19 01:04:03<stoopkid> like in our editor, we're gonna make it so you can switch out what lang you're using, or even have it parse some documents in different ways in different places
09/19 01:04:25<stoopkid> this is eventually sort of how i imagine the CNL being, by analogy
09/19 01:05:42<stoopkid> so, it wouldn't just be one language, it would be a system of logic that "knows" languages, and can learn more, and try to inference the language being used in a given situation
09/19 01:06:00<stoopkid> but, no need to get into that complexity yet
09/19 01:06:35<stoopkid> just saying, down the road i honestly imagine this turning into something that could be used as the basis for a robot brain
09/19 01:17:11<stoopkid> so, what the MLTT does is get us a natural, machine-interpretable logic, that corresponds closely to basic human logic, as well as human language (because our language naturally mirrors this logic)
09/19 01:19:17<stoopkid> "a person and a dog", "a person or a dog", "there is a person with a dog", "every person has a dog"
09/19 01:19:32<stoopkid> "a dog is an animal", "Fido is a dog"
09/19 01:20:28<stoopkid> ok so. we want it to be able to reason over statements of arbitrary logical complexity
09/19 01:21:00<stoopkid> i'll tolerate lack of linguistic complexity as long as it's got a full correspondence to logic
09/19 01:21:45<stoopkid> because then i know that even if i can't express my thoughts using my normal vocabulary, there is at least some way to express any logical concept/proposition i can imagine
09/19 01:22:04<stoopkid> cause if it can't do this, it's not gonna handle full CNL with linguistic complexity
09/19 01:23:03<stoopkid> so, natural languages aren't much like MLTT languages, like agda
09/19 01:23:34<stoopkid> but they allow us to communicate a concepts in a logic that *is* much like MLTT
09/19 01:28:00<stoopkid> so, i imagine we'd have a basic MLTT language allowing us to form MLTT expressions using concepts & vocabulary coming from a database
09/19 01:28:59<stoopkid> "A and B", "A or B", "there exists an object x in A such that B", "for every object x in A, B"
09/19 01:30:13<stoopkid> any valid types stored in the database would be usable in forming expressions like this
09/19 01:32:05<stoopkid> likewise you'd have objects of those types stored in the database
09/19 01:41:34<stoopkid> idk though there's a decent amount of work to do to sort out what should go where
09/19 01:42:06<stoopkid> some things that correspond to types in MLTT would correspond to something like database tables
09/19 01:42:23<stoopkid> other things that correspond to types in MLTT would correspond to something like queries against the database
09/19 01:45:42<stoopkid> other things don't even correspond to things "within" MLTT, for example the statement "Fido is a dog" is neither a term nor a type, it's a judgement
09/19 01:51:59*** Quit: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@109.107.211.244) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 265 seconds
09/19 01:55:48<stoopkid>   and then things like inductive types actually technically correspond to adding new deduction rules
09/19 01:56:43<stoopkid> so, there's 4 langs involved in MLTT: natural deduction, judgements, types/propositions, and objects/proofs
09/19 01:58:13<stoopkid> "data Nat = Zero | S Nat" is the same as:
09/19 01:58:18<stoopkid>  --------------------
09/19 01:58:24<stoopkid> Zero : Nat
09/19 01:58:25<stoopkid>  
09/19 01:58:40<stoopkid> G |- x : Nat
09/19 01:58:42<stoopkid> ---------------
09/19 01:58:51<stoopkid> G |- S x : Nat
09/19 02:05:07<stoopkid> anyway, let's not start with the CNL. we need to do a lot of work there
09/19 02:05:28<stoopkid> what i'd like to see first is using it as a language-definitions-and-tools-database
09/19 02:18:44<stoopkid> so, i'd wanna set up a plug-in system in order to be able to incorporate outside tools
09/19 03:15:45<stoopkid> so, there's 2 kinds of judgements, first is that some object is an element of some type, and the second is that two objects are defined to be equal
09/19 03:17:29<stoopkid> you see this in every bit of haskell code, for example:
09/19 03:17:35<stoopkid> f : Nat -> Nat
09/19 03:17:46<stoopkid> f x = S x
09/19 03:41:56<stoopkid> ok so, plug-in system
09/19 03:42:57<stoopkid> this could be as simple as just allowing the user to add shell commands that would run the 3rd party tools
09/19 03:48:34<stoopkid> we can already run those 3rd party tools like that anyway, and all this is doing is making a way to consolidate all your languages and their tools into one place to integrate their usage

09/19 17:38:54<stoopkid> hrm, vim is actually already quite equipped along the lines of being a language-definitions-system
09/19 17:41:43<stoopkid> that's kind of how i'd want it to be except i'd want to go beyond just having syntax files and color-coding and actually provide mechanism for including other tools associated with a lang like interpreters, compilers, debuggers, decompilers, etc..

09/19 20:31:10<editable-koo>what does vim have beyond syntax highlighting regexes?
09/19 20:32:13<stoopkid> aside from the ability to run shell commands, that's about it
09/19 20:47:29<sirdancealot> <stoopkid> wrt database, we don't want to have to recompile all the knowledge enco
              <sirdancealot> ded in MLTT every time we add/change some information
09/19 20:47:34<sirdancealot> i have no idea what youre talking about
09/19 20:50:11<stoopkid> let's say you have a C++ program
09/19 20:50:15<stoopkid> and you change something
09/19 20:50:19<stoopkid> you have to recompile it
09/19 20:50:44<stoopkid> beyond that you'll have to be more specific about what exactly you're not understanding
09/19 20:50:47<sirdancealot> ah so you were comparing mltt in a db vs mltt in files
09/19 20:50:54<stoopkid> right
09/19 20:51:14<sirdancealot> you keep getting me confused on a lot of fronts
09/19 20:51:25<sirdancealot> like the "vocabulary" thing you keep mentioning
09/19 20:52:31<sirdancealot> i really cant imagine how a mltt-based db would be used for some things that i know how a triplestore can be used for
09/19 20:52:34<sirdancealot> but
09/19 20:53:12<sirdancealot> if youre still into it, how about we make a little prototype in python
09/19 20:53:54<stoopkid> an mltt-db prototype?
09/19 20:54:19<sirdancealot> yeah
09/19 20:54:29<stoopkid> sure
09/19 20:56:34<stoopkid> so, wrt mltt vs. triple-store, surely you can imagine how an n3-based db could be used for everything that a triplestore or quadstore could be used for, and then literally infinitely more right?
09/19 20:58:20<sirdancealot> no, in my mind a n3-based db = triplestore
09/19 20:58:27<stoopkid> ah
09/19 20:59:34<stoopkid> well, then this mltt-db is essentially an n3-db but with mltt built-ins
09/19 21:00:14<sirdancealot> hrmpf
09/19 21:03:01<stoopkid> hehe ok we should probably go through the whole thing from the beginning and make sure we're on the same page just at least wrt terminology
09/19 21:04:15<editable-koo>hehe
09/19 21:04:29<editable-koo>i think id rather code now tho
09/19 21:05:55<stoopkid> the mltt/n3-db?
09/19 21:06:27<sirdancealot> no i want to improve the menu system in newshit a bit
09/19 21:06:50<stoopkid> ah, ok cool cause i was gonna say i'm not quite ready to jump into that db yet
09/19 21:06:59<sirdancealot> cool
09/19 21:11:19<sirdancealot> i had a curious day at work
09/19 21:11:50<sirdancealot> first i got to know folks in the warehouse and my namesake nextdoor
09/19 21:13:20<sirdancealot> and then i got a presentation on a system of tram depot control that 3 folks down the hallway work on
09/19 21:13:33<sirdancealot> the thing is, what we work on is also a system of tram depot control
09/19 21:14:20<sirdancealot> apperently some politics and lack of communication or will here and there made the company go schizo
09/19 21:14:40<sirdancealot> their system is like 10x more advanced and polished than ours
09/19 21:16:04<stoopkid> curious indeed. so would the current managers have your team working on a less advanced/polished version of what the other team is working on?
09/19 21:16:08<stoopkid> so why would*
09/19 21:16:39<sirdancealot> a problem with it apparently is that they cant get safety certifications for it, because the control is centralized in a complex server, while our system is based on PLCs doing all the core work
09/19 21:17:17<stoopkid> i see
09/19 21:18:26<stoopkid> so your PLC-based system is eventually supposed to live up to the precedents set by the other server-controlled system?
09/19 21:18:39<stoopkid> but meeting all the safety certifications
09/19 21:19:15<sirdancealot> yeah thats kinda the vision i think, its supposed to run without a human operator like the other one
09/19 21:21:37<stoopkid> makes a decent amount of sense. i'm familiar with the safety certifications thing with PLCs, that was a big reason that we didn't have much option to use anything more sophisticated or appropriate for the tasks at my last job; it would've been a lot harder to get all the safety certifications with anything besides a PLC which was already certified that it at
              <stoopkid> least wouldn't fail at the hardware/firmware level

09/19 22:00:04<sirdancealot> emacs is having memory leaks
09/19 22:02:01<stoopkid> i do wanna take a look at the scala stuff but i'm still working myself up to a point where i'd be ready to jump into it
09/19 22:02:49<stoopkid> i don't have a complete picture of how it would look either, i've just got some parts worked out and it seems a good guideline to follow
09/19 22:10:37<stoopkid> at the most basic level it'd just be like any MLTT system (agda, coq, etc..) except geared to handle CRUD operations and queries rather than just geared to be a "program that 'runs'"
09/19 22:11:39<stoopkid> your data being stored in that system doesn't necessarily "look" much different than it would in, say, a relational db, or regular triple-store, or an n3-db, or w/e
09/19 22:12:30<stoopkid> but your typing & query systems would have the full power of MLTT, for whenever you feel like you need this full power
09/19 22:13:52<stoopkid> you'd query against the kb, just like in n3, except you'd have the built-in MLTT functionality
09/19 22:14:33<stoopkid> and MLTT's auto-proving functionality would just be a form of query
09/19 22:15:31<sirdancealot> yeah i kinda get the idea
09/19 22:15:43<sirdancealot> so, class MlttNode?
09/19 22:18:51<stoopkid> hrm, i don't have a totally clear picture of how the MLTT would relate back to lemon nodes, but probably?
09/19 22:19:06<sirdancealot> not meant to be lemon related
09/19 22:21:32<sirdancealot> and in its simplest form, a database would be just an array of those
09/19 22:21:38<sirdancealot> or a map?
09/19 22:22:06<stoopkid> hrm, so what would be held in an MlttNode?
09/19 22:22:19<sirdancealot> it would be a superclass
09/19 22:23:51<stoopkid> what would be its subclasses though and what would they contain
09/19 22:25:10<sirdancealot> well i supose it would be the same hiearachy we have in lemon mltt?
09/19 22:25:20<sirdancealot> to, function type, literal..
09/19 22:26:47<stoopkid> ah, so this would be the superclass of MLTT expressions, and then a database would be an array of MLTT expressions?
09/19 22:26:56<sirdancealot> yeah?
09/19 22:28:43<stoopkid> i see. i've got one adjustment to that: it would be a map of MLTT types to arrays of stored proofs
09/19 22:30:14<sirdancealot> ic
09/19 22:30:21<sirdancealot> so its your proof db
09/19 22:31:06<stoopkid> more or less. essentially any "mltt-db" would be
09/19 22:32:31<stoopkid> but just about any kind of db can be viewed as a "proof db" for some logical system (which is generally not as powerful as MLTT), and queries against them can be viewed as some limited version of autoproving
09/19 22:34:29<stoopkid> like, let's take SQL for example. you've got some built-in base types like INT, STRING, DATETIME, etc.. and then you can form record types from these, which become the "types" of the records stored in tables that use those record types
09/19 22:34:49<stoopkid> the records are essentially proofs of the types
09/19 22:35:22<stoopkid> and then you can make SQL queries, which incorporate more logic. if we phrased these SQL queries in terms of MLTT, then the queries would be complex types, using logical operators
09/19 22:35:36<stoopkid> and the query process would be equivalent to the auto-proving process
09/19 22:35:57<stoopkid> existing records in the database are assumptions that the auto-proving process can use to form proofs (i.e. query results)
09/19 22:39:29*** Quit: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@236.152.broadband3.iol.cz) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 244 seconds
09/19 22:40:08<stoopkid> so, it's not exactly the proof-db, but both this and the proof-db would be based on an MLTT-db
09/19 22:40:42<stoopkid> now, if we didn't have the goal of supporting some reasonably sophisticated CNL for voice-control, then i wouldn't be opting to use an MLTT-db
09/19 22:41:26<editable-koo>hmm
09/19 22:43:17<stoopkid> and the main reason i'm opting to use an MLTT-db to handle the CNL for voice-control is because i think this is by far the most straight-forward and well-developed method available today for having a machine handle the logical statements that can't be avoided for any reasonable CNL
09/19 22:43:40<stoopkid> err, s/MLTT-db/MLTT at all/
09/19 22:45:15<stoopkid> we could get this same capacity with just an n3-db (maybe with some extra built-ins, not sure), but then you'd have to write all this basic logic yourself in MLTT and make sure that everything can be reasoned over coherently using w/e rules you write
09/19 22:47:33<stoopkid> err
09/19 22:47:44<stoopkid> you'd have to write all the basic logic in n3*
09/19 22:48:06<stoopkid> (the basic logic for reasoning over the logical statements that get expressed in CNL)
09/19 22:48:24<editable-koo>not sure why youd have to write logic in n3
09/19 22:49:52<stoopkid> well, lemme rephrase, *somewhere* you'd have to write logic that interprets & reasons over the CNL expressions
09/19 22:50:36<editable-koo>well, ill be curious to see some exmaples of stuff expressed in mltt
09/19 22:51:00<editable-koo>and i dont mean Nat and clusters of sets
09/19 22:52:30<stoopkid> what do you wanna see?
09/19 22:52:33<editable-koo>right now im considering biting the bullet and starting using rdfalchemy in newshit for a simple usecase

09/19 22:53:21<editable-koo>to store the currently displayed menu in it
09/19 22:54:43<editable-koo>not sure of the format even in n3 hehe
09/19 22:55:41<stoopkid> so you'd have a type of menus, and then an MLTT expression stating that "currentDisplayedMenu : Menu", and then you'd have "currentDisplayedMenu = <your current menu>", and then when your program is trying to figure out what menu to use, it queries the db for the value of currentDisplayedMenu
09/19 22:56:18<stoopkid> as one possibility
09/19 22:56:54<editable-koo>in python, its a list of items where each item has a dict with various components of a final sorting score, like {'textual match': 10, 'full parse':10, 'type match':10, 'in scope':10}
09/19 22:57:39<stoopkid> so then the type "Menu" would reflect that
09/19 22:58:18<stoopkid> or if you want to avoid having to come up with a type for it, then "Menu" can essentially just stand for a text type, and you just store plain-text configurations or JSON or w/e
09/19 22:59:07<editable-koo>that would work he he
09/19 22:59:22<stoopkid> you don't necessarily get to reason about your Menus to quite the same extent if you do that, but if you do that then it kinda suggests that you aren't trying to employ this more sophisticated reasoning over them anyway

09/19 23:01:42<editable-koo>rdf is so brainbending
09/19 23:02:08<stoopkid> heh, yea i'm not a fan
09/19 23:02:33<stoopkid> i'm amazed at how much ad-hocness they managed to add to something as simple as triples...
09/19 23:02:58<editable-koo>yea well thats kinda the beauty, like lisp
09/19 23:05:11<stoopkid> im not sure how that's the beauty, heh; it's exactly the brain-bendingness to me
09/19 23:10:30<editable-koo>for what i want to accomplish with the menu, the tripleness isnt actually needed
09/19 23:10:35<editable-koo>or the linkedness
09/19 23:11:45<editable-koo>it would suffice that id use a nosql, the key is that its a db thats a different process than my program, and that the data i store in there keep some self-descriptiveness
09/19 23:12:16<editable-koo>json, like you said

09/19 23:12:56<editable-koo>but if its one json blob you lose the ability to query for individual menu items or whatever
09/19 23:13:18<editable-koo>not without writing javascript
09/19 23:14:54<stoopkid> sure, yea nothing about this menu example motivates either a triple-store or an MLTT-db
09/19 23:15:24<stoopkid> tbh i'm not even sure it really motivates a nosql db cause the amount of data being stored there would be pretty small and there's definitely python libs for parsing json
09/19 23:15:49<editable-koo>its not about parsing json
09/19 23:16:02<editable-koo>its about making this data first-class
09/19 23:17:17<editable-koo>and, i think it would be cozy if i had them in a triplestore and could write a simple rule that would sum up their component scores and could use a query sorting and filtering them by it
09/19 23:17:27<stoopkid> there's no python libs for json to build it up into an object such that you can access it's members in a first-class way?
09/19 23:17:57<editable-koo>the angle im taking here is: if its in python, its not first-class
09/19 23:18:28<stoopkid> hrm, then i'm not sure what you mean by first-class here
09/19 23:18:43<editable-koo>the python interpreter doesnt make a good db
09/19 23:21:50<stoopkid> hrm yea i guess without a db system we'd have to write all the query/sort/filter functionality ourselves and it wouldn't be as optimal or vetted as it would be in a real db

              <editable-koo>you mean for the menu or for mltt db?
09/19 23:27:49<stoopkid> i mean for the menu, but yea for the mltt db we'd need some kind of db system unless we wanted to roll the whole thing ourselves
09/19 23:29:33<stoopkid> pretty much any kind of db would work, we'd just add extra MLTT logic "around" the database: i.e. type-checking things before we store them, making the auto-proving process work with db queries, etc..
09/19 23:30:01<editable-koo>yeah..
09/19 23:30:50<editable-koo>and we might get some advanced stuff like replication and transactions for free
09/19 23:30:55<editable-koo>almost free
09/19 23:31:13<stoopkid> hrm, can you elaborate?
09/19 23:31:28<editable-koo>on?
09/19 23:31:58<stoopkid> where we'd be getting this advanced stuff out of this
09/19 23:32:19<editable-koo>where?
09/19 23:32:59<editable-koo>if we build the mltt-db on top of some conventional db system
09/19 23:34:12<stoopkid> i mean how does that lead to replication and transactions "almost for free"
09/19 23:35:04<stoopkid> it sounds right, i'm just having a brain malfunction or something; not seeing the link here
09/19 23:35:44<editable-koo>well if we use for example mysql to store our mltt stuff, then we'll have some add() function that does the typechecking and then calls INSERT
09/19 23:36:10<editable-koo>and we'll have a commit function that calls mysql commit
09/19 23:36:42<editable-koo>so, we have our data transactioned
09/19 23:37:12<stoopkid> ah, right, i see
09/19 23:37:20<stoopkid> yea exactly
09/19 23:40:28<stoopkid> we'd maybe still want to open up the transaction system to the user, but yea the MLTT would be handling a big set of transactions automatically/for-free, and ideally the user wouldn't need transaction-control beyond this
09/19 23:40:41<stoopkid> haven't thought it through to that point yet though
09/19 23:40:51<stoopkid> wouldn't need much**
09/19 23:45:15<editable-koo>doesnt make sense to me
09/19 23:45:23<editable-koo>its the user who needs transactions in the first place
09/19 23:45:54<stoopkid> and the MLTT subsystem is essentially such a user
09/19 23:45:55<editable-koo>if the mltt layer ends up doing multiple modifications per one user-modification, then it needs transactions as well
09/19 23:46:14<editable-koo>or needs to be covered under user's transactions
09/19 23:47:43<editable-koo>a simple example where transactions are useful is a cms system where when you are deleting a user, you want to delete all his posts too
09/19 23:48:13<editable-koo>transactions protect your other code from seeing the db in a state where there are posts that belong to an invalid user
09/19 23:48:48<stoopkid> sure
09/19 23:48:53<editable-koo>i guess you think you can handle that on the mltt typesystem level?
09/19 23:49:55<stoopkid> we could but i don't know if we need to or even should necessarily
09/19 23:50:49<stoopkid> the mltt would automate those transactions that it uses, which would overlap somewhat with the transactions that a user would normally have to write themselves, that's all i meant
09/19 23:52:19<stoopkid> and i think there's ways we could allow the user to take advantage of the MLTT to automate more transactions, but.. that's getting ahead of ourselves
09/19 23:53:26<stoopkid> for example, in your delete a user & their posts example, if the fact that posts "belong" to a user can be indicated, then the MLTT can potentially delete everything that belongs to an object when it deletes that object

09/19 23:54:39<stoopkid> is there any advantage to doing this within MLTT rather than a separate transaction system? i can't really see any, just throwing out possibilities
09/19 23:56:32<stoopkid> the benefits to an MLTT-db relative to existing databases would be that you can store a much much wider variety of objects and validate that they're objects of a particular MLTT datatype
09/19 23:56:50<stoopkid> so, for example there's no SQL column type for "functions", let alone "functions that satisfy such and such properties"
09/19 23:57:27<stoopkid> and then you have a much more powerful & generalized query system over your db, using the auto-proving process
09/19 23:58:12<stoopkid> so, any example that would motivate an MLTT-db would include either a) more complex objects that need to be stored and verified, and b) more complex queries that need to be supported
09/19 23:59:29<stoopkid> CNL provides an endless supply of these examples, as does anything where we're talking about a database for code or a database requiring complex reasoning

09/20 16:44:49<stoopkid> cool, finally gonna be starting the web dev stuff with my neighbor
09/20 16:45:49<stoopkid> she's setting a drop-box up so i can check out the projects, and then i'll see if any of it's something i can reasonably handle in w/e the timeframes are
09/20 16:46:43<stoopkid> which i'm sure that pretty much all of it will be, after my conversations with her, it seems like it's mostly really simple stuff that you only wouldn't be able to do if you had literally no understanding of how it all works
09/20 16:46:55<stoopkid> like, she didn't even know what DNS was
09/20 16:47:55<stoopkid> and she says she doesn't know how to do any web-dev outside of WYSIWYG editor, which only handles layout anyway

09/20 17:06:50<editable-koo>thumbs up
09/20 17:10:27<stoopkid> i was worried about starting this without a portfolio site; figured it wouldn't look good for a web dev not to have a portfolio site
09/20 17:11:00<stoopkid> but one of the first things she said was that she was struggling to get a portfolio site set up and that maybe i could help her with that
09/20 17:11:14<stoopkid> so... works for me i guess?
09/20 17:12:05<editable-koo>hehe
09/20 17:12:09<editable-koo>what does she do?
09/20 17:15:19<stoopkid> her and her husband find web-dev work and contract it out to devs and she does a bit of graphic design & photoshop work i think
09/20 17:15:48<stoopkid> that's all i really know, only got a chance for a quick convo with her a bit earlier
09/20 17:17:41<editable-koo>interesting
09/20 17:58:15<editable-koo>ive been pondering how to go on but cant decide
09/20 17:59:12<editable-koo>more and more im starting to think of concrete pieces of a higher level lang
09/20 18:00:05<editable-koo>that would solve all my problems in implementing...itself
09/20 18:00:22<editable-koo>but in fact not itself but the editor

09/22 17:37:40<editable-koo>i did
09/22 19:06:28<stoopkid> hrm, yea i think i saw it a long time ago and forgot about it
09/22 19:17:06<editable-koo>we gotta go semantic:)
09/22 19:17:15<editable-koo>or "this, too, is why we build lemon"
09/22 19:22:17<editable-koo>i gotta say...even this 20 hours/week engagement is probably taking away my energy for coding other things
09/22 19:22:58<editable-koo>well im learning qt...so i suppose thats good
09/22 19:24:00<editable-koo>as on the high level lang...im thinking in terms of a language for describing pieces of a program
09/22 19:24:07<editable-koo>"nodes are a class hierarchy"
09/22 19:24:54<editable-koo>now, palette() is a function in nodes
09/22 19:25:19<editable-koo>i want a special projection for it, like a table
09/22 19:25:29<editable-koo>with a column for class and a column for some code
09/22 19:32:22<stoopkid> what's this palette() function do?
09/22 19:36:45<stoopkid> "i gotta say...even this 20 hours/week engagement is probably taking away my energy for coding other things", eh, even 20 hours/week is a decent amount especially since with this kind of work since i'm sure you spend more than 20 hours/week thinking about it
09/22 19:37:22<stoopkid> s/<one of the "since"s>//
09/22 19:40:45<editable-koo>palette() returns items that should be added to the menu
09/22 19:41:43<stoopkid> so the table would be like <menu item, class, code-for-menu-item-to-run> ?
09/22 19:42:24<editable-koo>just class, code
09/22 19:43:44<stoopkid> so, what are the classes going into the table and what's is the code that's being associated to them?
09/22 19:44:59<editable-koo>thats irrelevant for discussion of the higher level language
09/22 19:46:07<stoopkid> so what's the relevant part then
09/22 19:46:40<editable-koo>just the fact that i want a language to talk about a fragment of code
09/22 19:50:02<stoopkid> but like, what kind of fragments of code & what kind of things do you want to be able to express about them in the higher-level lang?
09/22 19:52:15<editable-koo>lets say you have a hierarchy of classess and each class overrides this one function
09/22 19:53:37<editable-koo>so, its a matter of projection if you look at it like:
09/22 19:53:41<editable-koo>class A:
09/22 19:53:46<editable-koo>def palette()...
09/22 19:53:48<editable-koo>class B:
09/22 19:53:53<editable-koo>def palette()..
09/22 19:53:57<editable-koo>or:
09/22 19:54:00<editable-koo>class A:...
09/22 19:54:04<editable-koo>class B:...
09/22 19:54:11<editable-koo>def palett(): 
09/22 19:54:17<editable-koo>if isinstance(s, A):...
09/22 19:54:22<editable-koo>elif isinstance(s, B
09/22 19:54:25<editable-koo>):..
09/22 19:55:38<stoopkid> ah so you'd have a table listing out your classes that descend from Node, and the code associated to each class would be that class's version of palette() ?
09/22 19:55:53<editable-koo>yeah
09/22 19:56:34<editable-koo>im actually in the process of rewriting this function in newshit into the second form
09/22 19:56:49<editable-koo>because its a mess
09/22 19:57:02<editable-koo>but at different times different projections are bett
09/22 19:57:03<editable-koo>er
09/22 20:00:19<stoopkid> hrm, so the first form is projecting them as if each class has as a member it's own special version of palette() and in the second form you're projecting them as if all the classes are using some kind of "universal" palette() function that differentiates based on the class that's calling it?
09/22 20:00:42<editable-koo>so i suppose i first want a language to speak about the language
09/22 20:00:43<editable-koo>yes
09/22 20:01:12<stoopkid> i like that (being able to project it into different but equivalent forms)
09/22 20:03:20<editable-koo>everybody will
09/22 20:06:17<stoopkid> so would the code here be python or code written in languages built in lemon?
09/22 20:06:41<editable-koo>dunno
09/22 20:11:42<stoopkid> i'm thinking restricting it to just python would make sense at the beginning, since i think there would be a lot of details to work out to get code written in languages built in lemon to operate "seamlessly" with the python
09/22 20:12:15<editable-koo>what do you mean operate with python?
09/22 20:13:29<stoopkid> like, if you build a language in lemon and then write some code in it, your code wouldn't necessarily have access to any of the objects & functions in the rest of the python code-base
09/22 20:14:20<stoopkid> like if i had "if isinstance(s,A): <some MLTT code>", our MLTT language can't, for example, access "s" or "A" and do things with them
09/22 20:15:25<editable-koo>ah
09/22 20:16:51<stoopkid> but then again, nobody ever said that code written in MLTT necessarily needs to access anything like that
09/22 20:17:15<editable-koo>yea
09/22 20:17:41<stoopkid> so, maybe it makes sense to allow both and if the code is written in a language built in lemon then there may or may not be some limitations compared to using the python, but the python is always there as a fall-back if you need it
09/22 20:20:03<editable-koo>yea well i have no idea about any of that yet
09/22 20:22:27<stoopkid> two options that both seem sensible to me would be to either restrict it to just python at the beginning and just have <class, code>, or allow either python or any language you've built in lemon and extend the projection to <class,language,code>
09/22 20:24:00<stoopkid> but, either way this seems like a relatively straight-forward feature to add
09/22 20:25:21<stoopkid> if the lang is python you just eval() the code, and if the lang was built in lemon then you'd use the standard method for executing code written in that lang
09/22 20:29:49<stoopkid> now, how are you planning to handle code highlighting? seems to me the code-highlighting for a lang should be separate from the lang definition itself so that you can potentially have multiple highlighting schemes for the same lang
09/22 20:31:51<editable-koo>syntactic highlighting is bs anyway
09/22 20:32:19<editable-koo>if youre into it, we'll find a way to plug it in
09/22 20:32:48<stoopkid> what do you imagine instead? semantic highlighting?
09/22 20:34:36<editable-koo>yea seems more useful
09/22 20:35:22<editable-koo>usual syntactic highlighting doesnt even seem applicable to lemon lang
09/22 20:35:53<stoopkid> well, i do like the sound of that
09/22 20:36:18<stoopkid> are there any semantic highlighting systems already? can't say i'm familiar with anything of the sort
09/22 20:37:56<editable-koo>systems?
09/22 20:39:16<stoopkid> tools, frameworks, packages, libs... something already built that provides an approximation of what you have in mind
09/22 20:40:37<editable-koo>probably a couple
09/22 20:41:37<stoopkid> i guess any editor that has semantic error highlighting is a simple example
09/22 20:46:30<editable-koo>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12552623
09/22 21:28:41<stoopkid> i wonder how many viruses my dad must have to make our internet so slow
09/22 21:29:16<stoopkid> i need to get a packet analyzer and figure out wtf is going on
09/22 21:30:11<stoopkid> i'm trying to clone a package from github and it's averaging about 15 KiB/s
09/22 21:31:18<stoopkid> like, i'm pretty patient with a slow internet connection but this is getting pretty ridiculous





09/23 00:17:35<stoopkid> i hate emacs
09/23 00:28:05<stoopkid> i should rephrase: i dislike it when using an emacs mode requires installation of a bunch of other modes and a bunch of configurations as if emacs were an operating system...
09/23 00:28:43<stoopkid> like, if i wanted an OS, i'd use linux, oh wait, i already was
09/23 00:31:12<stoopkid> and when i install a package on linux, it does the sensible thing which is to install all the dependencies and automatically handle the configurations...
09/23 00:32:40<stoopkid> plus i'm not like an emacs pro or anything so this whole process is extremely confusing..
09/23 00:33:36<stoopkid> and to add insult to injury, my 15 KiB/s internet connection is making it take forever to find instructions online
09/23 00:50:18<stoopkid> my new goal: build lemon into a sensible replacement for vim and emacs
09/23 00:52:49<stoopkid> oy
09/23 00:52:57<stoopkid> and then when you find their instructions, they don't even work
09/23 00:53:17<stoopkid> "Then press C-M-x with point somewhere in this form to install and enable Flycheck for the current Emacs session."
http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/
09/23 00:53:21* stoopkid presses C-M-x
09/23 00:53:30<stoopkid> "C-M-x is undefined"
09/23 01:43:54<stoopkid> and finally i manage to get it installed
09/23 01:44:03<stoopkid> and now that it's installed, it doesn't work
09/23 01:44:04<stoopkid> great
09/23 01:45:51<stoopkid> like, there should never be this much trouble to install something unless you're actually doing a serious amount of customization and not just trying to use *the only editor that exists for a language*
09/23 05:02:28<stoopkid> so, after looking at some systems for syntactic highlighting, i think i'm getting a clearer picture of how to handle semantic highlighting
09/23 05:03:11<stoopkid> for example, vim has syntax files to describe the syntax & its highlighting for a lang
09/23 05:03:46<stoopkid> you can name/group keywords and syntactic structures and assign highlighting information to them
09/23 05:04:50<stoopkid> for semantic highlighting, i'm thinking it would essentially be the exact same idea except you'd do this for the structures that can appear in your ASTs
09/23 05:06:16<stoopkid> so, in lemon's case, that would be the node classes that we define
09/23 05:06:54<stoopkid> in mltt's case that'd be Var, ParExp, PiType, etc..
09/23 05:07:26<stoopkid> so you could just define highlighting information directly in these classes
09/23 05:07:47<stoopkid> you're probably thinking "yea obviously"
09/23 05:08:39<stoopkid> took me a bit to work out how that transition from syntactic to semantic would actually look under the surface tho
09/23 05:09:35<stoopkid> now, after thinking a bit deeper into it, i think syntactic highlighting is still necessary
09/23 05:10:23<stoopkid> let's say i try to write out a pi-type or a lambda expression, and i mess something up so there's a syntax error
09/23 05:10:36<stoopkid> since there's a syntax error, it doesn't parse
09/23 05:10:49<stoopkid> since it doesn't parse, it never becomes associated to a semantic value
09/23 05:11:33<stoopkid> since it never becomes associated to a semantic value, it wouldn't get any highlighting (if all the highlighting was defined in the node classes)
09/23 05:12:48<stoopkid> i'd think that if you make a syntax error that prevents the expression from being parsed into a semantic value, that syntactic highlighting should be employed as a fall-back
09/23 05:15:02<stoopkid> so, the way i'm imagining that is that essentially there would be a standard syntactic highlighting system, but for any given expression, if that expression can be successfully parsed into a semantic value, then the semantic highlighting would override the syntactic highlighting
09/23 05:16:05<stoopkid> that seems good to me except for a (relatively minor) issue that the syntactic highlighting and semantic highlighting probably shouldn't "clash" with each other
09/23 05:16:28<stoopkid> like, let's say my syntactic highlighting takes the keyword "Pi" and makes it blue and bold
09/23 05:16:55<stoopkid> but then let's say that the semantic highlighting defined in the PiType class makes the "Pi" be yellow and italic
09/23 05:17:48<stoopkid> ideally there could be some mechanism that could allow the user to ensure that their syntactic and semantic highlighting schemes "agree" everywhere that they overlap
09/23 05:18:58<stoopkid> but, like i said, imo that's a relatively minor issue since it can be solved by the user simply being careful, and there may be cases where the user doesn't necessarily want their syntactic & semantic highlighting schemes to agree everywhere
09/23 05:20:25<stoopkid> one situation might be if the programmer wants visual indication of which expressions have successfully parsed and which haven't, but actually wants some kind of highlighting on the expressions that don't parse (as opposed to just having it default to unhighlighted text)
09/23 05:20:54<stoopkid> another issue, which isn't quite so minor:
09/23 05:21:50<stoopkid> in pretty much any IDE, there will be error highlighting
09/23 05:23:14<stoopkid> there's syntactic error highlighting, which is pretty straightforward; if the expression doesn't parse then underline it in red (or however the user wants to highlight that)
09/23 05:23:34<stoopkid> that can be defined with the rest of the syntactic highlighting
09/23 05:23:43<stoopkid> semantic error highlighting is a bit trickier
09/23 05:24:10<stoopkid> especially if we went with this method of sticking the semantic highlighting info in the node classes
09/23 05:25:06<stoopkid> so, you probably see what the issue here is now: take our MLTT implementation for example, all the node classes there are only defining types of expressions that *successfully* parse
09/23 05:26:18<stoopkid> so, that system needs to be extended with ways to talk about various kinds of semantic errors, and assign different kinds of highlighting to them
09/23 05:27:01<stoopkid> at the moment i don't see any other serious issues
09/23 05:27:36<stoopkid> and both of these seem solvable (though i can't say i have any clear ideas of what the specific solutions would be)
09/23 05:29:04<stoopkid> maybe you could go over with me what you've worked on in regards to talking about semantic errors within lemon (if you've done anything to that end yet)
09/23 05:31:40<stoopkid> lol, it's kind of funny that each of us has a channel we could be using and you've specifically got the lemon dev channel, and yet recently we've only been talking about lemon dev in jmv's eulerGUI channel
09/23 05:32:31<stoopkid> we need to come up with a name for the new tau already so that we can move lemon dev back into the lemon channel lol

09/23 10:07:39<editable-koo>this channel/topic intermixing is good i think
09/23 10:07:57<editable-koo>as on semantic highlighting, i havent thought about it much
09/23 10:08:29<editable-koo>in newshit there is a system of arrows, if you use some identifier somewhere it draws an arrow pointing to its definition
09/23 10:09:04<editable-koo>as on "highlighting", i like the idea that we would color each variable within a function a little differently
09/23 10:09:50<editable-koo>id suggest to think out of the box of coloring text and more about drawing additional info around the text
09/23 10:10:14<editable-koo>and yea what you say makes sense, syntax highilighting/feedback is necessary
09/23 10:10:55<editable-koo>but none of this seems like a key component, so..
09/23 10:11:31<editable-koo>dude, today on the train i was listening to two guys chat, one working in netflix or somesuch, pushing online tv into africa
09/23 10:12:01<editable-koo>the other has some kind of app development framework and now theyre making a simplified version that could be marketed as a kind of end user programming
09/23 10:12:09<editable-koo>i should have talked to him
09/23 10:12:49<editable-koo>here i am with my day job making these kind of shitty apps instead of making a framework for users to make them themselves
09/23 10:14:12<editable-koo>but i dont think the problem is purely technological, i could push this app out in 14 days if el chefe didnt know only one way to build this kind of apps and for some mysterious reason i didnt have to build it perfectly scalable 
09/23 10:14:34<editable-koo>dude's a dumbass
09/23 10:20:58<editable-koo>at least i think im gonna use exactly this for the new gui

09/28 18:56:24<sirdancealot> so, the situation at work feels pretty shitty
09/28 18:56:40<sirdancealot> im gonna try to stick thru for now
09/28 18:57:31<sirdancealot> but i have this vision it would be nice to quite the job and take some time for myself and stuff
09/28 18:57:41<sirdancealot> to finish the newshit stuff
09/28 18:57:56<sirdancealot> and ive decided i want to learn java
09/28 18:58:11<sirdancealot> or perhaps scala or c#
09/28 18:58:20<sirdancealot> learn as in get proficient in it
09/28 18:59:31<sirdancealot> iow, to take time to raise my value
09/28 19:08:41<stoopkid> not a bad idea

09/28 19:17:17<stoopkid> well, she sent me their current page too i guess she wants me to rework their page into something that looks like the mockup
09/28 19:17:49* stoopkid doesn't know how this page is being generated but let's see if i can find out
09/28 19:18:38<stoopkid> i'm totally gonna call her and ask for clarification but let's see if i can answer all the stupid questions before i do that

09/28 20:24:08<editable-koo>btw, ive been playing with redmine, or rather, redmine is what i use in work a little, just looking up uploaded files really, but ive been playing with easyredmine.com
09/28 20:24:26<editable-koo>its redmine with some plugins or something
09/28 20:24:45<stoopkid> i have no idea all i got was some photoshop documents that look exactly like what it already is except on a couple of them "Blog" is added to the header
09/28 20:24:53<editable-koo>its quite a complete thingy, you got time tracking, tasks and priorities and file management and stuff
09/28 20:25:18<editable-koo>well, time to call i guess
09/28 20:29:15<stoopkid> yea i just e-mailed her like an hour ago saying i'd check it out so i'll just call her tomorrow, apparently time isn't a huge concern anyway it took her two weeks to send me some  photoshop docs that are already what it is
09/28 20:31:19<stoopkid> people are funny
09/28 20:31:59<editable-koo>im glad i dont have to deal with this kind of shit now
09/28 20:32:16<editable-koo>have different kind of shit instead
09/28 20:32:21<stoopkid> anyway, this job's looking like it's gonna be a piece of cake on the technical end, looks like the majority of the work is gonna be me just figuring out wtf she actually wants me to do lol
09/28 20:32:49<stoopkid> heh yea i'm just not gonna worry about, kinda means i don't have to do all that much
09/28 20:33:23<stoopkid> im definitely not feeling a lot of pressure lol
09/28 20:37:44<stoopkid> so, if i can get like $500 a month out of this that'd probably cover my bills & rent to my parents and i can chill for a while
09/28 20:39:35<editable-koo>you think you can?

09/28 20:45:20<stoopkid> idk it's not setting the expectations very high though, if she can't generate $500 worth of web dev work for me a month i'll be really confused as to how she's maintaining her own lifestyle
09/28 20:45:33<stoopkid> and i can definitely take on way more than.... whatever the hell this is lol
09/28 20:48:41<stoopkid> well, i gather she wants me to make a mock-site based on the current site and her photo-shops, and that shouldn't be hard, so maybe i'll just set up a mock site and a couple different versions of what i think she means and let her pick or refine her specifications
09/28 20:49:22<stoopkid> the site looks like it's pretty much all browser-side, so shouldn't have trouble there
09/28 20:56:04<stoopkid> a couple of the things break if you just save the page and reopen it, i guess i'll have to fix those up

09/28 20:58:34<stoopkid> that's not a bad design pattern for websites actually. shouldn't matter where you open the browser-side tool from
09/28 21:00:26<stoopkid> let's you hire front-end devs without exposing the back-end and makes it easier for everybody on the front-end
09/28 21:01:30<stoopkid> also lets you satisfy the basic intuition that if you save a file and then reopen it you should get the same thing
09/28 21:02:41<stoopkid> i guess that pattern only really works on a site that's not very interactive
09/28 21:08:32<stoopkid> heh, from a pragmatic perspective if i just fix these issues then i have my mock-up in hand lol
09/28 21:09:50<stoopkid> this site is particularly not very interactive and the things that do break when you save and reopen it are definitely things that there's no reason this should happen, like the backgrounds
09/28 21:18:25<stoopkid> only 3 things seem to break if you just save & reopen, let's see if i can fix those and then i've got a mock site
09/28 21:21:24<editable-koo>you mean save locally as a html file?
09/28 21:25:06<stoopkid> right
09/28 21:43:59<stoopkid> seems like the easiest way to go about this and actually come back with a completely working thing from these minimal specifications along with options rather than just questions
09/28 21:44:23<editable-koo>dunno
09/28 21:44:29<editable-koo>hope its gonna work for you
09/28 21:45:10<stoopkid> heh, no idea
09/28 21:51:22<stoopkid> i should probably curl it rather than save it from the browser
09/28 21:51:58<editable-koo>well, the goal is that users can save the page?
09/28 21:52:17<stoopkid> no the goal's a mockup of the site
09/28 21:52:39<editable-koo>ah
09/28 21:53:19<editable-koo>might be good to get access to the server
09/28 22:02:36<stoopkid> probably, normally i'd just be asking that already but i'm confused by the fact that the images describing the mockup i'm supposed to be making look exactly like the page that's already there, and the easiest way i could get a "mock up", which has been left completely undefined but as best i can gather/guess it's something you can have locally that
09/28 22:02:37<stoopkid> implements the front-end functionality without needing the back-end to deliver it to you, is just to save the html page and make it work when you start it locally
09/28 22:04:23<stoopkid> and since that would only take me like an hour and i need to get familiar with this anyway i might as well i guess, and then idk how it could be more "mock" besides just removing functionality
09/28 22:08:38<editable-koo>hmm
09/28 22:11:47<stoopkid> and when i say exactly i mean it literally just is the page, there's only two discernible differences i can tell in any of the 6 images she sent me from the pages they correspond to
09/28 22:12:44<stoopkid> and they're so minor that i can't tell if they're accidental, because the 6 images are only of 3 of the pages, so some of the versions of page have the change and others don't, and there are other things that are obviously just mistakes like a random margin on one of the images
09/28 22:13:17<stoopkid> or a "continue reading" button on an image that already had a "learn more" button
09/28 22:13:18<stoopkid> lol
09/28 22:48:38<editable-koo>i gotta try to sleep

09/30 01:13:17<stoopkid> so i heard back from her
09/30 01:13:49<stoopkid> she said that my approach would make sense, but that she was just giving me an exercise to see if i can build up the site from scratch
09/30 01:16:18<stoopkid> but my approach even if i were building the site from scratch would be to totally just rip off the existing code
09/30 01:16:24* stoopkid shrugs
09/30 01:17:55<stoopkid> i have like a million more questions for her but i feel like i'm just supposed to go about it however i'd think to go about it and not hound her with questions

09/30 17:10:10<editable-koo>exercise huh
09/30 17:11:06<editable-koo>tbh from what you say it feels like the kind of engagement id rather stay away from

09/30 17:45:45<editable-koo>if i said lets finish tau now, would you have a plan?
09/30 17:52:25<stoopkid> not quite yet, but i'm getting closer
09/30 18:22:47<editable-koo>just curious:)
09/30 18:36:33<editable-koo>so, it may not sound too surprising, but one optimization i should do in my life is to bring my job and interests closer
09/30 18:36:45<editable-koo>iow, find a job related to lemon and stuff
09/30 18:36:59<editable-koo>or start monetizing on my interests
09/30 18:40:15<editable-koo>when i worked 6 hours/day, i couldnt find any time for lemon
09/30 18:41:15<editable-koo>now im working 4, i do at least find time to catch up with you and maybe read a java book or something, or try some scala or work on newshit once in a while
09/30 18:41:34<editable-koo>but thats all
09/30 18:43:14<editable-koo>also, im in a silly situation where im paying rent for a flat where i spend mostly just weekends
09/30 18:43:28<editable-koo>since its just easier to crash in my moms place on the way from work
09/30 18:43:49<editable-koo>and all my friends and stuff are here
09/30 18:44:29<editable-koo>i want to find a flat near my workplace, always wanted to live there regardless of the company
09/30 18:44:57<editable-koo>but it could become silly if i quit there before i even move into it
09/30 18:45:07<editable-koo>if i put things into motion now
09/30 18:54:17<stoopkid> yea would be nice to just get paid for the shit we actually work on somehow
09/30 18:54:52<sirdancealot> yea gotta start taking it seriously
09/30 18:55:03<sirdancealot> people run kickstarters on all kinds of crap
09/30 18:55:37<sirdancealot> and there are other options
09/30 18:56:58<stoopkid> hypothetically people are supposed to be able to make money from these block-chain things
09/30 18:57:04* stoopkid still hasn't figured it out yet
09/30 18:57:09<sirdancealot> hehe
09/30 18:58:06<sirdancealot> apparently you gotta start your own currency or something
09/30 18:58:50<stoopkid> do you wanna buy my fake money from the clouds?
09/30 18:59:17<stoopkid> gets 'em every time
09/30 18:59:36<stoopkid> practically sells itself
09/30 19:00:20<stoopkid> amazingly it actually would if we made tau
09/30 19:04:24<stoopkid> my plan with that is to figure out an abstract model of tau such that i can prove that it satisfies the required properties, and then figure out an implementation which is provably an instance of the abstract model
09/30 19:06:11<stoopkid> in the process i'm taking all the relevant results in theoretical comp sci and trying to formalize them into type theory
09/30 19:07:07<stoopkid> and provide more rigorous definitions for all these results so that they're interoperable in a cohesive fashion
09/30 19:07:58<stoopkid> once i have the abstract model and i can prove it satisfies the required properties (i.e. that it can construct a tau) then i'll translate that into implementation
09/30 19:08:13<stoopkid> some aspects of the implementation are required just by the form of the problem
09/30 19:09:19<stoopkid> and i'll try to find out exactly what aspects these are, and formalize that into a formal abstract protocol, such that the implementation implements it
09/30 19:10:11<stoopkid> and then.. that's tau
09/30 19:18:21<stoopkid> when i get the point that i have a provable abstract model of it, then i'll be ready to ask for money to build the thing
09/30 19:24:23<sirdancealot> sounds....reasonable, captain kirk

10/02 17:07:32<sirdancealot> yo
10/02 17:07:44<stoopkid> yo
10/02 17:21:23<stoopkid> i'm getting addicted to coq
10/02 17:22:27<stoopkid> but it's somewhat frustrating because it's very difficult to make your results interoperable
10/02 17:24:44<stoopkid> coq makes it like ridiculously easy to prove any particular basic theorem (where "basic" can actually get pretty sophisticated), but only if you've built up preliminary results in a form that's interoperable with the form in which you've expressed the proposition
10/02 17:26:24<stoopkid> you can always go back and rebuild your results in a way that *is* interoperable, but i find i'm often repeating myself just to shift the form of things slightly just to make them fit, even though none of the semantics or structure between the different forms really changes much
10/02 17:28:07<stoopkid> a lot of it has to do with IDE as well
10/02 17:32:44<stoopkid> just reaffirms my belief that these systems are like the machine code of logic, not the end-all-be-all of it
10/02 17:33:16<stoopkid> not even machine code, it's just the circuitry
10/02 17:33:39<stoopkid> tactics are more like the machine code
10/02 17:33:54<stoopkid> and we've yet to see any higher level logic languages
10/02 17:34:54<stoopkid> things like HoTT are just building better circuitry, still not a higher level logic language
10/02 17:36:10<stoopkid> here's an issue for example which demonstrates the "low-levelness" of it:
10/02 17:37:04<stoopkid> i'm doing this proof that requires me to show that (false = true) -> False
10/02 17:37:35<stoopkid> i've already proven that (true = false) -> False and that (A = B) -> (B = A)
10/02 17:39:27<stoopkid> so, i can finish the proof easily, but Coq doesn't help me find these other proofs i've already given, no semantic search capacity is exposed to the user really, even though it must have plenty under the surface
10/02 17:40:21<stoopkid> if you want interoperability, you've got to make many many many different proofs of different conversions
10/02 17:40:47<stoopkid> and since there's no semantic search/referencing capacity, you've got to come up with a bunch of names for these
10/02 17:40:58<stoopkid> and there's no good naming system; there just isn't
10/02 17:41:36<stoopkid> too much variety of too much complexity, and english just can't cut it
10/02 17:41:55<stoopkid> really string identifiers just can't cut it
10/02 17:42:58<stoopkid> but coq only gives syntactic referencing abilities, so we're screwed there, and we have to make as few as possible of the most general results that we can, otherwise it's just ridiculous
10/02 17:43:04<stoopkid> also, it should be a database
10/02 17:43:06<stoopkid> obviously
10/02 17:43:15<stoopkid> idk why they didn't make it a database to begin with
10/02 17:43:54<stoopkid> these automated theorem prover systems that aren't databases are just preposterous
10/02 17:45:18<stoopkid> content-addressable database solves the whole naming thing and exposes the semantic lookup to the user, which would seriously facilitate the interactive proving process
10/02 17:47:44<stoopkid> next problem: polymorphism
10/02 17:48:01<stoopkid> polymorphism is fantastic, but it sucks to actually have to write it and use it explicitly
10/02 17:48:10<stoopkid> coq is again no help here
10/02 17:48:32<stoopkid> my proof that converts (A = B) -> (B = A) is called Id_is_symmetric
10/02 17:48:52<stoopkid> it needs to take a bunch of arguments that give type information so that it can actually do the conversion
10/02 17:49:08<stoopkid> it's hard to remember what order this is supposed to go in or what it needs
10/02 17:52:26<stoopkid> ah, actually i can type in a line "Check Id_is_symmetric"
10/02 17:52:32<stoopkid> kinda clunky though
10/02 17:53:10<stoopkid> if i was on a command line i'd be like, sure, but this is a full-scale interactive theorem proving ide, i should probably just be able to hover/click it
10/02 20:25:36<editable-koo>:)
10/02 20:56:05<editable-koo>rdflib seems to work in python 3
10/02 21:04:31<editable-koo>i still seem to need to put my life more in order before i can focus on lemon
10/02 21:04:53<editable-koo>its the usual situation, it sucks because it seems so close to a major milestone
10/02 21:09:43<stoopkid> yea, i'm hoping to keep my life just in order enough to make it to the point where i can get something out of all this tau stuff
10/02 21:10:12<stoopkid> plan Bs can sometimes just interfere with plan As
10/02 21:10:26<stoopkid> get in the way of them *
10/02 21:14:09<stoopkid> i seem to be getting close to being on HMC's level with this theoretical comp sci shit
10/02 21:14:20<stoopkid> had a breakthrough the other day; not sure what happened
10/02 21:15:01<sirdancealot> maybe hmc had a breakdown
10/02 21:15:20<stoopkid> ah, that explains it
10/02 21:21:03<sirdancealot> what do you mean not sure what happened?
10/02 21:22:22<stoopkid> not sure why all the computability theory shit all of a sudden made sense
10/02 21:49:44<sirdancealot> we may never know
10/02 23:31:41<sirdancealot> i think i see the light too
10/02 23:31:46<sirdancealot> python 3 is dead
10/02 23:31:51<sirdancealot> im porting newshit back to 2
10/02 23:32:52<stoopkid> heh

10/09 21:24:01<rszeno> thank you stoopkid
10/09 21:24:24<stoopkid> hey no problem, did you get it figured out?
10/09 21:24:49<rszeno> no, they are a bunch of idiots
10/09 21:28:16<rszeno> hm, that means, you didn't get the money, actualy nobody get it
10/09 21:29:10<stoopkid> well hopefully it's still there somewhere
10/09 21:29:59<rszeno> who care if are useless for anybody
10/09 21:30:19<stoopkid> well, i meant somewhere such that you can access it :)
10/09 21:31:12<rszeno> how? i bet not even the idiots from paypay can't
10/09 21:31:28<rszeno> paypal i mean
10/09 21:32:31<stoopkid> if they lost it then keep hounding them for a refund until they give it to you, cause legally i'm sure they're supposed to be keeping some records of all that anyway
10/09 21:33:46<rszeno> i doubt they even know what this mean
10/09 21:35:02<rszeno> plus google is another shit this days
10/09 21:36:52<rszeno> doesn't matter, I will start a campain against paypal, to look as bad it is posible

10/10 22:42:30<editable-koo>yeah
10/10 22:44:07<stoopkid> he apparently couldn't get into his account, he was wondering if i changed the info
10/10 22:44:38<editable-koo>if you changed the credentials of his account?
10/10 22:44:43<stoopkid> yea
10/10 22:45:22<editable-koo>he gave them to you earlier?
10/10 22:45:42<stoopkid> yep
10/10 22:45:53<editable-koo>i see
10/10 22:46:14<stoopkid> and then he told me to change the credentials after i used the money in the account
10/10 22:46:26<editable-koo>i suppose you guys triggered their triggers
10/10 22:46:55<stoopkid> well, i never managed to log in because it needed to verify my device with an SMS to rszeno

10/11 16:44:56<editable-koo> real world programming:
10/11 16:46:12<editable-koo>lets write an an command parser from scratch because using a library has more drawbacks
10/11 16:47:17<editable-koo>regexes would make things simpler but they are too hard, lets better have inferior error detection and nasty loops with lenghty ifs
10/11 16:49:51<editable-koo>the electronics team wrote last week saying they wanted to have the first working version of the app "now"
10/11 16:50:39<editable-koo>instead of adding two buttons now that i finished and tested all the core code, the boss ends up starting a rewrite
10/11 16:52:39<editable-koo>then the guy sitting at the next table speaks up and says he wrote exactly this, just for a different modem brand, a year ago for another project

10/14 10:56:06<sirdancealot> key-value stores, for one
10/14 10:56:37<sirdancealot> rdflib docs
10/14 10:57:37<sirdancealot> a week or two back i was on an intel workshop, got a couple nice pointers for further optimization of univar, or just so
10/14 10:57:53<sirdancealot> *cppout
10/14 10:58:03<sirdancealot> i guess
10/14 10:59:49<sirdancealot> ive also been reading up on stuff like java EE and wpf
10/14 11:00:29<sirdancealot> and ofc at work im acquiescing myself with qt
10/14 11:02:17<sirdancealot> im doing everything else than working on newshit
10/14 11:04:41<sirdancealot> but i guess a positive way to look at this is that im acquiring an overview wrt the job market and my options
10/14 11:05:48<sirdancealot> im planning to try their demo http://www.semantacorp.com/
10/14 11:05:53<sirdancealot> i guess youd find BI interesting
10/14 11:06:17<sirdancealot> and sis's bf knows most of the technologies that this sw interfaces with
10/14 11:07:10<sirdancealot> it sounds like at the core this is a linked-data laced wiki, but who knows

0827175250<sirdancealot> np
0827175531<rszeno> what you are doing? still working to tau?
0827175544<sirdancealot> not on tau
0827175602<rszeno> trams tests?
0827175619<sirdancealot> today ive been fixing some small issue with newshit, but im distracted all day
0827175634<sirdancealot> yep tram tests most of all
0827175721<rszeno> automate the work as much as you could
0827175732<sirdancealot> the tram tests are now almost done and i should get my 30k czk soon
0827175756<sirdancealot> to automate it was my job:)
0827175820<rszeno> fine, about tests,:)
0827175841<sirdancealot> im a difficult situation now tho
0827175856<rszeno> can i help?
0827180125<sirdancealot> dunno. they offer me 40k for a full work week
0827180231<rszeno> and? you don't know what to do?
0827180234<sirdancealot> i want to work less, they are fine with that
0827180337<sirdancealot> well, i guess you cant help me with anything
0827180348<sirdancealot> also too much distraction here now
0827180504<rszeno> ok, mail me if you need help. Is not a certitude that i can but i will try.
0827180547<sirdancealot> writing mails is too hard:)
0827180556<rszeno> distraction is good, even if you try to avoid is necessary
0827180619<rszeno> writing mail? wow, :)
0827180728<rszeno> you don't need something formalized, just tell what is about, :)
0827180820<rszeno> mail is very good for me,:)
0827180902<rszeno> chating too but keep busy both parts
0827180927<sirdancealot> its that i wish i had been writing my work hours this past month
0827181034<sirdancealot> yeah but when i think about a problem its often impossible to formulate fully
0827181041<rszeno> a kind of deary/log
0827181120<rszeno> doesn't matter when i don't understand i ask,:)
0827181321<rszeno> i use to log everything so even if i forget is there
0827181401<sirdancealot> while True:
0827181402<sirdancealot> 	time.sleep(2)
          <sirdancealot> 	os.system("scrot  -q 80 /home/kook/screenshots/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).png")
0827181403<sirdancealot> :)
0827181512<rszeno> well, is good but to often and hard to search,:)
0827181625<sirdancealot> a few gb per day
0827181632<rszeno> using toolbox is a must,:)
0827181654<rszeno> grep, find, ...
0827181801<rszeno> actualy when you need will become more complex
0827181843<rszeno> n3 is good for me, :)
0827181916<sirdancealot> will be nice when i can actually make any use of n3 like that
0827182028<rszeno> all you need is to put everything as a n3 description first
0827182101<rszeno> then to use a reasoner to infere or find what you need
0827182113<sirdancealot> yes thats the theory
0827182214<rszeno> no, is practice. First time i seen this 16 years ago
0827182250<rszeno> Dan Connaly, spmebody from w3c
0827182344<rszeno> mail, sites, every piece of info
0827182517<rszeno> Tim Bernard Lee is another example,:)
0827182619<rszeno> anyway is not very easy but is not impossible
0827182628<sirdancealot> i know
0827182839<rszeno> are a lot of missing tools to make n3 from everything but ... i done a lot, both they done too
0827183106<rszeno> http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
0827183243<rszeno> Mad Mode is his site right now
0827183555<sirdancealot> probably good stuff there
0827183740<rszeno> depend on topic,:) but yes at least are good ideas to follow
0827183933<rszeno> a search on the web will show a lot of his contributions
0827184056<sirdancealot> my second problem: newshit is a total mess
0827184143<rszeno> missing planning?
0827184225<sirdancealot> i dont know better designs
0827184242<rszeno> usualy mess is a consequnce of planning
0827184248<sirdancealot> the code stays up to date with my knowledge
0827184256<sirdancealot> its the knowledge thats lacking:)
0827184318<rszeno> about what? domain?
0827184422<sirdancealot> programming language
0827184437<sirdancealot> formal language in general
0827184521<rszeno> define the problem, maybe i could help
0827184549<sirdancealot> the problem is very broad
0827184625<sirdancealot> have you seen any newshit screenshots lately?
0827184643<rszeno> no, can I?
0827184929<sirdancealot> just a minute..
0827184949<rszeno> np
0827185053<sirdancealot> http://i.imgur.com/m6soQ9g.png
0827185233<rszeno> what's in the left and right sides?
0827185242<sirdancealot> right shows a menu
0827185255<sirdancealot> autocomplete menu basically
0827185322<sirdancealot> left is a tree-structured ui/shell/editor/anything
0827185430<rszeno> ok, what is the problem?
0827185439<sirdancealot> hehe
0827185441<sirdancealot> the language
0827185505<sirdancealot> i have no clue what im doing
0827185622<rszeno> left side are bash commands?
0827185646<sirdancealot> no, its "the language"
0827185701<sirdancealot> its just mostly bash calls there
0827185717<sirdancealot> i have a function definition and a call
0827185759<rszeno> try to focus on concepts and their relations
0827185910<rszeno> a bash command is a string, you can describe it using a kernel of words ( concepts and relations )
0827185946<rszeno> a language is only a set of concepts and some rules
0827190031<rszeno> a most general name for 'bash' is 'shell' :)
0827190051<rszeno> so what is a shell?
0827190209<rszeno> some keywords and a set of rules to decide what to do with something called arguments
0827190311<rszeno> you didn't start backwords?
0827190413<rszeno> i mean identifying parts ( words ) before isolating concepts?
0827190509<rszeno> right side look like a frequency of some input
0827190547<sirdancealot> there is some sorting by relevance and similarity to what is typed in
0827190634<rszeno> who decide what is relevant and/or similar and how?
0827190653<sirdancealot> parsing results thrown in too
0827190702<sirdancealot> textual similarity by levenshtein distance
0827190719<sirdancealot> and theres a kind of type system / syntax system
0827190745<sirdancealot> on the screenshot the parameter is expected to be a number
0827190822<sirdancealot> so number gets good score if it parses
0827190954<rszeno> you want to deal with unpredictable input or is a given gramatical structure?
0827191022<sirdancealot> given
0827191110<sirdancealot> dealing with unpredictable input would be cool but its not current domain/focus
0827191121<rszeno> so everything will end, after parsing, with a tree
0827191134<sirdancealot> right
0827191141<sirdancealot> or a few trees
0827191203<rszeno> with all elements of known types and values
0827191210<sirdancealot> yes
0827191321<rszeno> having multiple trees need to deal somehow with them. What you do?
0827191334<sirdancealot> menu:)
0827191400<rszeno> for each tree you have a menu?
0827191405<sirdancealot> its more of a theoretic problem for now, i ofc try to avoid ambiguity in practice
0827191414<sirdancealot> no, each parse tree becomes an item in the menu
0827191518<sirdancealot> i didnt yet implement a parser that would parse the whole document at once, only currently edited bit
0827191610<rszeno> that is ok, imo
0827191648<rszeno> kind of working session i suppose
0827191720<sirdancealot> i dont think structural editing is as necessary as i used to, but hey i built it and it kinda works, while the parser side still isnt finished
0827191731<sirdancealot> working session what do you mean?
0827191825<rszeno> today you use a document tommorow another, each is a working session
0827191840<rszeno> editing i mean
0827191851<rszeno> or what you do
0827191915<sirdancealot> i just ressurected this one after fixing some serialization problems:)
0827191936<sirdancealot> i tried to use this document for running stuff i usually run
0827192009<sirdancealot> i also mean it as a showcase of what newshit can do so far
0827192045<rszeno> what is doing in the end?
0827192148<sirdancealot> its a shell and a programming language and a notepad and a language for defining context free languages and writing stuff in them
0827192233<rszeno> ooops, :)
0827192257<rszeno> that's a huge task
0827192312<sirdancealot> its not a task its an accident:)
0827192330<sirdancealot> or, logical conclusion
0827192332<rszeno> how this?
0827192356<rszeno> is somehow my fault? :)
0827192426<sirdancealot> dunno, its my toy:)
0827192553<rszeno> is ok, np :) I asked if is my fault because i always insisted on grammars
0827192657<sirdancealot> my idea has always been to have a hard grammar
0827192719<rszeno> my zamolex is such a farmework, bendis is on top of it
0827192735<sirdancealot> zamolex?:)
0827192810<rszeno> sorry, zamolxe, is old work since '70
0827192856<sirdancealot> sounds old
0827192911<sirdancealot> framework for a language?
0827192917<rszeno> it take a given grammar and analyse it or transform
0827192955<rszeno> for any language from 3 to 0 in chomsky hierarhy
0827193050<rszeno> building a grammar from test or whatever is another story
0827193111<rszeno> text not test
0827193141<sirdancealot> im ok with defining grammars by hand for now:)
0827193339<sirdancealot> do you know about naproche or fmathl?
0827193355<rszeno> ok, not a problem, :) but is still a lot of theory in defining grammars and language
0827193408<rszeno> no i don't know
0827193429<rszeno> links? something?
0827193440<sirdancealot> http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/FMathL.html
0827193527<sirdancealot> they agree that a grammar and a type system can be one thing
0827193557<sirdancealot> at least one of them agree, i forgot which one:)
          <rszeno> aha, i use a sort of metamath for this ( instead of fmath)
0827193637<rszeno> a grammar, a type system and a formalism are equivalent
0827193723<rszeno> so once you use one is using any other of later
0827193758<rszeno> i use grammars, old school, :)
0827193922<rszeno> acualy, one view, mine, a grammar describe both the typing system and also the formal system
0827194002<sirdancealot> whats a formal system?
0827194101<rszeno> a set of variables names, another of rules and it's closure
0827194226<rszeno> once you define 'identifier' in a grammar you define the set of names used for variables
0827194323<sirdancealot> in the end i will go back to my messy Nodes and Nodecls and Refs and Varrefs..
0827194355<rszeno> and also how is builded, use for parsing, what it is, agregation, building compounds vars, etc
0827194435<rszeno> a grammar have basicly only terminals and nonterminals
0827194531<rszeno> so you can stay with this and define the rest base on it
0827194619<rszeno> actualy is not something 'better' whatever you do, imo
0827194749<rszeno> aha, Neumaier
0827195044<rszeno> too much matematica imo, it hide the unerstanding of the tasks, :)
0827195121<sirdancealot> :)
0827195155<rszeno> i'm talking about the CAS
0827195338<sirdancealot> by CAS you mean the proof checker part?
0827195410<rszeno> he use mathlab and mathematica, this confuse the students
0827195443<rszeno> CAS - computer algebra system, doing math with it
0827195525<sirdancealot> ok
0827195635<rszeno> is  better then maxima but maxima have the avantage of seeing its internals
0827195644<sirdancealot> i want to make money, not math:)
0827195722<rszeno> one way is to automate work, :)
          <sirdancealot> you should get an android device
0827195731<rszeno> i have
0827195751<rszeno> few in fact
0827195859<sirdancealot> so..personal assistants with their shitty regexes...newshit can replace those
0827195903<sirdancealot> and this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=AutomateIt.mainPackage&hl=cs
0827195929<sirdancealot> and let people go deeper and create scripts and apps
0827195958<rszeno> is nothing semantic on google, just mess, :)
0827200140<rszeno> regex are usefull but usualy are missused, :)
0827200231<sirdancealot> misunderstood
0827200238<rszeno> is a type 3 chomsky grammar usualy
0827200304<rszeno> yes, all kind of misses, :)
0827200333<sirdancealot> i have some old attempts at a grammar for making regexes readable somewhere
0827200415<rszeno> is hard
0827200426<sirdancealot> hard?
0827200433<rszeno> yes
0827200537<rszeno> clustering terminals for example
0827200609<sirdancealot> whats that mean
0827200618<rszeno> it follow one of [a list of chars]
0827200710<rszeno> then a range, a char between two consecutive chars
0827200734<rszeno> so [ab-z] is what?
0827200739<sirdancealot> you dont parse regexes with a cfg?
0827200821<rszeno> sometimes, often is a 1 type
0827200842<rszeno> not cfg i mean
0827200910<sirdancealot> the regex specification?
0827200915<rszeno> type 1 and 0
0827200931<rszeno> yes regex specs
0827201009<rszeno> depend of what restrictions you impose
0827201019<rszeno> pcre is not cfg
0827201028<rszeno> for example
0827201222<rszeno> anyway a type 1 can be tarnsformed
0827201234<sirdancealot> you make everything sound like a problem..:)
0827201240<rszeno> also a type 0
0827201318<rszeno> well it is, that's life :)
0827201337<sirdancealot> the problems are wholly elsewhere..
0827201345<sirdancealot> do you like Cher?
0827201357<sirdancealot> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcptWSAiNWA

0827201729<rszeno> is only the slot, Rookies. I don't remeber it.
0827201749<sirdancealot> what do you mean slot?

0827223447<rszeno> did it help? our last chat
0827223621<sirdancealot> with newshit? not with the issues at hand:)
0827223726<rszeno> plan and change, make clear what intended to do
0827223741<rszeno> this is what i usualy do
0827223851<rszeno> in case that is something wrong i go back to last version who worked

0827225626<rszeno> right now are milioners,:)
0827225702<rszeno> is about rdf part of the semantic web,:)
0827225746<sirdancealot> yeah?
0827225749<rszeno> weird? no, are oportunities of a new path
0827225825<rszeno> yes, Kingsley Uhi Idehen
0827225847<rszeno> he come from Nigeria
0827230012<rszeno> he open a company, Open Link and make money with Virtuoso, a reasoner
0827230112<rszeno> is not the only one and he worked hard to succed
0827230130<sirdancealot> nice
0827230146<rszeno> yes, it is, :)
0827230258<rszeno> despite having money he have passion
0827230423<rszeno> still now i'm not clear if is Open Link or Openlink, :)
0827230636<rszeno> anyway, i promote him anywhere he try, for example now on linkedin
0827230843<rszeno> richard branson had a bycicle accident, ogly
0827230915<rszeno> https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/my-life-flashed-my-eyes
0827231739<rszeno> you have a linkedin account?
0827231745<sirdancealot> no
0827231842<rszeno> why?, imo is good to have it.
0827231900<sirdancealot> no reason
0827231942<rszeno> you don't need a reason, is a way to find new peoples
0827232026<rszeno> some are weird as usual but most are normal

0829113444<rszeno> sirdancealot, i'm trying to put togheter a software freelancers team. You are interested? No work available at this moment!
0829113533<rszeno> no idea how or even will be payed
0829113630<rszeno> missing a if will be payed in previous sentence
0829145306<sirdancealot> yep im in:)
0829145341<sirdancealot> but first, did you watch sausage party?:)
0829145442<rszeno> not yet, missing storage space
0829145523<rszeno> free space first then i'll see it,:)
0829145530<sirdancealot> ok
0829153547<rszeno> i searched on freenode channels with name containing 'lisp': 7 rooms, 1 definitivly is not lisp
0829153623<rszeno> 7 except the ones i used before
0829162110<rszeno> 5 are, 1 is undecided yet, :)
0829162156<sirdancealot> :)
0829162232<rszeno> #lispclub is undecided
0829162235<rszeno> :)
0829162342<rszeno> 4 members with me, here we are only 2, :) number is not an issue
0829162630<rszeno> a bot for finding channels on a server will be good. Hard to define what to find but where is easy: channal name, topic, eventualy logs
0829162752<sirdancealot> :)
0829163432<rszeno> warweasle, have a project called qix, is in a way what i do and what you do in the same place
0829163509<rszeno> except he doesn't realise how complex will be
0829163559<rszeno> see this if you need: https://github.com/BradWBeer/Qix
0829163758<rszeno> and this for general info: http://lisp-qix.blogspot.ro/, google shit '.ro' will be probably replaced
0829163905<rszeno> skip the shaders part
0829163938<sirdancealot> i know
0829164007<rszeno> i'm curios if he explored the gpu and gl part of shaders,:)
0829164035<sirdancealot> what other part is there?
0829164048<sirdancealot> i tried to talk to him at some point
0829164112<sirdancealot> “Create a Document Object Model similar to modern web browsers DOM API. The ability to work with 2D and 3D with the same tools and a single language should produce a powerful system for displaying, editing and sharing documents of any kind. “
0829164229<rszeno> it doesn't because you need to choose a system or to make to work will any
0829164301<rszeno> in the end is a 'in place code' to handle this
0829164359<rszeno> you need a reasoner for decisions, coding if's doesn't work, is too expensive
0829164518<rszeno> this is how software companies make money, :)
0829164543<rszeno> not the reasoner part,:)
0829164616<sirdancealot> i want to turn newshit into an android app
0829164721<sirdancealot> must put some more work into it, then create a demo
0829164727<rszeno> you can generate js from python, not high quality, usualy need manual bug fixes
0829164730<sirdancealot> then find some marketinghead :)
0829164735<sirdancealot> yea been there
0829164804<sirdancealot> there was nothing to handle a project as heavy as newshit
0829164808<sirdancealot> maybe pypy-js
0829164831<rszeno> marketing is not hard today
0829164833<sirdancealot> anyway i dont have a problem with a rewrite into another language, thats the least of work
0829164911<rszeno> see my linkedin connections for marketing, some of them
0829164922<sirdancealot> :)
0829164951<sirdancealot> well, first i have some contacts of my own
0829165004<rszeno> in last time my focus was on management, :)
0829165043<rszeno> just join linkedin and connect with me, i will help
0829165213<rszeno> but you need to spend some time daily to make you look 'interesting' for other fuure connections
0829165259<rszeno> just to read and click what you like
0829165441<sirdancealot> sounds self-destructive
0829165635<sirdancealot> i sent you a jaguar
0829165744<rszeno> good,:)
0829165907<rszeno> yes, sound self-distructive, from time to time it is, when is nothing interesting, but is somesort of fun usualy
0829171510<rszeno> where is the jaguar?
0829171633<sirdancealot> i sent you a message
0829172054<rszeno> you are Jindrich Kolman? on linkedin?
0829172135<rszeno> i have a message from him right now
0829172214<sirdancealot> yup
0829172237<rszeno> ok, :)
0829172358<rszeno> skill part from profile is missing, usualy this will trigger more connections
0829172434<sirdancealot> and you have past employers missing:)
0829172442<sirdancealot> cant "recommend" you
0829172459<rszeno> i have a lot of missing stuff,:)
0829172503<sirdancealot> ok time to go home
0829172517<rszeno> don't recommand me,:)
0829172554<sirdancealot> ttyl
0829172710<rszeno> ok, put the skill back, you need for promotions, :)
0829172822<rszeno> it must be something in configuration, i seen this before

0829173750<kookoochoo> the jaguar?
0829174021<rszeno> anything, in this case the 'atachment' probably the jaguar
0829174037<kookoochoo> :)
0829174139<rszeno> linkedin told me that is some attachemnt but i simply can't find it
0829174224<rszeno> they use too much js,is a mess
0829174355<rszeno> use gmail for this, except making noise linkedin is useless
0829174450<rszeno> ah, maybe for jobs, emploiments but is not my task
0829174742<rszeno> despite this i have at least one HR in my connection, accidents maybe usefull for some of my connections, i hope
0829175213<rszeno> sometimes i ask myself if is ok to have such connections but peoples are interesting so in the end diveristy is good,:)
0829184928<rszeno> send me the jaguar again but use gmail

0829190513<rszeno> android is a shit
0829203149<editable-koo>my boss worked on blackberry
0829203157<editable-koo>he says it has a microkernel
0829203229<editable-koo>and that they killed the os off and new blackberries are android
0829203317<editable-koo>about freelancing, have you talked to stoopkid yet?
0829203332<editable-koo>he is looking for a job more or less
0829203409<rszeno> no, i didn't taked
0829203415<rszeno> talked
0829203443<rszeno> i'm not sure if will be something payed
0829203532<rszeno> is hard to make peoples to work without money
0829203551<rszeno> even with money it's hard,:)
0829203619<editable-koo>well, for working without money, we each have our pet projects
0829203651<rszeno> i lost some enthusiasm after my last chat with her
0829203707<editable-koo>her?
0829203740<rszeno> yes, one of my contacts, bibhuna babu
0829203818<rszeno> bidhuna not bib..
0829203841<rszeno> is a indian software developer
0829203901<editable-koo>your idea was that we'd do something for her?
0829203930<rszeno> actualy he seems to be also contarcter, ...,a lot of things
0829203942<editable-koo>he or she?
0829203956<rszeno> no, i hoped to do something togheter
0829204002<rszeno> is a she
0829204023<rszeno> my mistake, with he
0829204228<rszeno> btw if you have somebody who need some software, they do and you can take some money
0829204257<editable-koo>sounds nice:)
0829204332<rszeno> kind of, but this assume you do the contact with them
0829204434<rszeno> usualy only first contract is payed( i don't know, is my assumption)
0829204540<rszeno> anyway is a way to get some money. :)
0829204704<editable-koo>what do you mean first contract?
0829204711<rszeno> indian companies have high prices, a indian said this, i never work before with them
0829204722<rszeno> first project
0829204901<rszeno> if a company need more then one project, you represent the contact only first time because next time they already know them,:)

0829205514<rszeno> well,actualy the only work i like is my own projects,some times not even thouse
0829205644<rszeno> now for example, i'm sick of working to bendis, is like never end
0829205718<editable-koo>im very low on stamina too
0829205735<editable-koo>well, a bit higher in the last few days

0829205849<editable-koo>i have the job
0829205857<rszeno> chating, linkedin, movies, anything else
0829205921<rszeno> well, is for making money, is boring
0829205928<editable-koo>are you good at soldering?
0829205942<editable-koo>http://www.ebay.com/itm/20-x-White-LED-Lamp-Light-Set-20cm-Pre-Wired-3mm-12V-DC-/250776821446
0829205952<rszeno> i'm paralised, partial
0829210013<editable-koo>i take that as a no:)

0829210100<rszeno> yes, is a kind of no
0829210153<editable-koo>btw the situation with my job...
0829210245<editable-koo>he is offering 40kczk for 3 months test period and then 50
0829210246<rszeno> something is wrong with ebay prices, is to expensice
0829210259<editable-koo>yes its expensive everywhere
0829210330<rszeno> not realy, check alibaba
0829210337<editable-koo>so i ordered 50 smd leds and im gonna see if i can solder them decently..
0829210418<rszeno> you din't need a machine? are smd
0829210442<editable-koo>they dont solder the wires with any machine imo
0829210458<editable-koo>its not so hard
0829210523<editable-koo>dunno how hard to make it look good
0829210539<rszeno> i don't know
0829210624<rszeno> afaik soldering smd is expensive
0829210654<editable-koo>i only know its fun
0829210716<rszeno> the past they use is few thousend dolars a box
0829210753<editable-koo>but thats for reflow soldering to a pcb
0829210821<rszeno> true
0829210912<rszeno> whats the difference in fact?
0829210938<editable-koo>difference of what?
0829211050<rszeno> this led stuff and soldering on pcb
0829211111<editable-koo>these leds arent on a pcb, they just have two wires soldered onto them
0829211131<editable-koo>you can do it with gun solder..
0829211308<editable-koo>making a machine for doing it would be nice...
0829211414<rszeno> see alibaba.com
0829211424<editable-koo>im not sure i see any pre-wired leds there
0829211502<editable-koo>it says "pre-wired", but the pictures dont show it, and their supply ability would suggest they have a machine for it
          <rszeno> look for dong guang and leds
0829211543<editable-koo>nothing
0829211641<editable-koo>i need sleep, gn:)

0905011336<rszeno> hi all
0905013247<stoopkid> hey rszeno
0905013404<stoopkid> koo told me you wanted to start a freelance software dev group
0905013517<rszeno> yes but is only a wish at this moment
0905013613<stoopkid> well, i'd be up for that, i'm about to set up a portfolio site for myself so i can start doing some freelance web dev stuff anyway
0905013635<rszeno> i have a project, maybe, but no money for it
0905013713<stoopkid> what's the project
0905013724<rszeno> all i need are people who are thinking, :)
0905013747<rszeno> a reasorener and a kb behind
0905013837<stoopkid> what kind of reasoner/kb? i'm familiar with type theory systems and systems like prolog
0905013922<rszeno> i sort of know you and i trust you
0905014156<rszeno> peoples who are thinking usualy learn what they need, i tust this,:)
0905014209<rszeno> tust -> trust
0905014312<rszeno> harder think is to make clear what i want,:)
0905014518*** Join: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@236.152.broadband3.iol.cz, (unauthenticated): realname)
0905014529* rszeno and how => minimal set of required tools
0905014703<rszeno> profesional market is a mess right now
0905014751* rszeno conclusion triggert by linkedin events
0905014917<rszeno> to much focus on margins, peoples who 'execute' some actions and other side
0905015007<rszeno> peoples who invent what must be done by first category
0905015238<rszeno> bad idea imo, somebody must administrate what is happend but they seems are useless after market
0905015255<stoopkid> not sure what you mean exactly
0905015424<rszeno> if we supose you write the code, will take some time to do this and almost all administrative work is on you
0905015511<rszeno> same thing with the one who ask you to do the job
0905015615<rszeno> the communication part is between you and the boss
0905015747<rszeno> administration is a difficult task, and also your and you need to know what is the state o the whole job at hand
0905015838<stoopkid> definitely
0905020012<rszeno> a foreman/superviser as a job was invented to solve this kind of stuff but is a kind of shame in doing this,:)
0905020024<stoopkid> a shame why?
0905020122<rszeno> nobody on linkedin is not of this kind,:)
0905020148<rszeno> all are super x or simple workers
0905020229<rszeno> to much modesty or proud, probably
0905020406<rszeno> some pople doesn't trust themself enough to say louder they can do something
0905020438<rszeno> other belive they can do but can't realy deliver
0905020536<rszeno> linkedin is a interesting place,:)
0905020904<stoopkid> sorry bad connection here
0905020922<stoopkid> well, people are strange like that
0905020953<rszeno> no problem with connection
0905021045<rszeno> yes, peoples are kind of strange but easy to understand
0905021243<rszeno> allmost everything depend of few attributes
0905021300<rszeno> age, gender and location
0905021359<rszeno> even missconceptions
0905021544<stoopkid> those things would never factor into my criteria if i were hiring for software dev work except *maybe* location, if the job really required it
0905021624<rszeno> maybe you can help me to understand what the story about Hillary is so important for americans
0905021728<rszeno> yes, location is factor but with 'working remote' is less important imo
0905021927<rszeno> is better to see somebody reactions when you say something but i don't know if si realy something which somebody can count
0905022047<rszeno> a good actor can play the cheater role, in the end what remain is trust and results
0905022054<stoopkid> which story with hillary? and yea for software dev working remote could be more efficient if there was a good process in place with good technical support for the remote communication process, and ofc it would often be a necessity like for example with you and i here
0905022145<rszeno> hillary: something with secret mails deleted
0905022151<stoopkid> oh that
0905022236<rszeno> how this can make her a good or bad president?
0905022412<rszeno> peoples lie often, mainly in a sensitive position when can lose something
0905022532<stoopkid> well, for one it just indicates corruption in the case that the deleted e-mails were actually hiding something, or at least indicates general negligence if they weren't, and i don't think these are things we should tolerate from any government officials let alone high-ranking ones like senator, secretary of state, or god forbid commander in chief of the
          <stoopkid> military
0905022642<rszeno> but a human make mistakes, nobody can stop this
0905022732<rszeno> btw, i'm for her, imo is better then Trump
0905022739<stoopkid> the question is whether or not it was a mistake, and my stance with government officials is that at the very least we shouldn't promote them until they can demonstrate their innocence
0905022826<rszeno> probably was at begining and end with doing on purpose the rest
0905022910<rszeno> imo is a experience which will never forget
0905023009<rszeno> all this noise and scandal will make her more carefull then somebody who didn't do it
0905023021<stoopkid> i agree she's better them Trump, because I think Trump would immediately shake everything up by removing the current executive officials and replacing them with conservatives and supporters of big money, and same with the supreme court judges some of which would probably be up for nomination especially if he landed a second term
0905023048<stoopkid> which would be all the more likely if he landed the first term
0905023220<rszeno> probably, i don't trust Trump because he does't seem to think
0905023248<stoopkid> when he talks he doesn't sound like he actually understands what the authority of the president even is
0905023319<stoopkid> and what disturbs me is that all of his supporters don't seem to understand it either
0905023325<rszeno> all what he say seems prety an impulse imposed by who is talking to
0905023406<rszeno> true, :)
0905023531<rszeno> i told two times on linkedin that Hillary is better and they simply attack me,:)
0905023611<stoopkid> what disturbs me most though is that the general american public thinks that the fact that the decision comes down to these two and that we basically have no choice but to pick one is somehow an acceptable situation
0905023658<rszeno> is same problem every where in the world, right now
0905023753<rszeno> USA should be happy that is not so bad like here,:)
0905023926<rszeno> nobody listen what you say and politicians care only if can make money for themself,:)
0905024026<rszeno> a blomberg world,:)
0905024103<stoopkid> true, doesn't mean we shouldn't still strive to do as best as possible here though, rather than tolerate a perhaps better but still generally inadequate system
0905024123<rszeno> sure,
0905024245<rszeno> what i hope is the next president of yours will care more about internal state of usa then of outside word.:)
0905024327<stoopkid> that'd probably be trump tbh
          <rszeno> this intermix is not good in general
0905024445<rszeno> so will be some war? I have the feeling this is more probable with Trump then with Hillary
0905024618<rszeno> is BREXIT and EU on one side
0905024702<rszeno> I don't trust Makrel in general
0905024830<rszeno> everything is looking like to the begining of 19xx
0905024918<stoopkid> trump talks big about amping up the fighting and annihilating terrorists and shit, but i don't think he's really that serious about that as much as he is on internal shit like cutting taxes on big business and the wealthy, switching up the executive branch to install more social conservatives, etc... it's hard for me to imagine that war is really something
          <stoopkid> he could be that serious about because he's never been involved with it before
0905025014<rszeno> Germany is hidind behing behind EU
0905025048<rszeno> an economic war is still a kind of war
0905025213<rszeno> peoples doesn't get anything good from this, just big words and povery
0905025235<stoopkid> idk that hillary wouldn't wage whatever kinds of economic war against other nations that trump would though
0905025304<rszeno> probably is no difference
0905025314<stoopkid> i think hillary might wage ever-so-slightly less of an economic war against at least US citizens though heh
0905025343<rszeno> on top they have other priorities
0905025414<rszeno> i mean being on top, president or whatever
0905025424<stoopkid> always, this is the fundamental flaw with highly verticalized society, especially when institutionalized by law
0905025503<rszeno> we don't have anything better,:)
0905025630<rszeno> if are two peoples somewhere one must be the boss, else everything is going down
0905025818<rszeno> colaboration is a hard task
0905030042<stoopkid> i disagree that there need be anything such as "bosses", per se. main function of a "boss" is as a central point for the others to coordinate around, like the wheel around an axis, the problem is when people confuse the central focal point as being "above them"
0905030112<rszeno> what is your favorite prog. lang?
0905030205<stoopkid> probably agda
0905030223<rszeno> yes, being boss require others skills
0905030306<rszeno> so haskell?
0905030311<stoopkid> indeed, administration is no easy task, and a lot of coders hate doing it
0905030331<stoopkid> haskell works too, to some extent
0905030432<stoopkid> my reasons for picking this as a favorite though aren't anything to do with my ability to roll out fully-featured software in it efficiently, they're just well designed with a solid theoretical foundations and a lot of cool capabilities with the type system
0905030511<rszeno> i had hoping something more basic/primitive like c or..,:)
0905030542<rszeno> sirdancealot?
0905030544<stoopkid> c/c++, python, or something like that is what i'd use for a real project
0905030613<stoopkid> (unless that project really called for the sophistication of something like agda)
0905030631<rszeno> so c is good? not c++ or c11 or a like?
0905030705<stoopkid> c works, i just learn whatever lang everyone wants to use
0905030732<stoopkid> (err, i already know c though, mostly)
0905030737<rszeno> is like a game engine, you must first define a new language for work
0905030814<sirdancealot> i prefer lemon lang
0905030845<stoopkid> any time i've had a job as a software dev it was never using a language i used at any of the previous jobs, so, they all just kind of look the same to me at this point
0905030902<rszeno> you can write a parser/crosscompler to c from lemon?
0905030923<sirdancealot> i could
0905031053<rszeno> good, then will end with c with our own framework each
0905031103<sirdancealot> lol
0905031220<rszeno> finding a source of money is first priority now
0905031240<rszeno> we must live in a way,:)
0905031346<stoopkid> i agree. got any plans wrt how to go about that?
0905031350<rszeno> try to think if we can use freelance and an automated process for this
0905031414<sirdancealot> what do you mean use freelance rszeno?
0905031449<rszeno> geting projects for money and reusing code to fullfill it
0905031529<rszeno> being a team is more powerfull then alone
0905031614<stoopkid> there's things we could automate there which would be useful. what i doubt though is that the effort to design and implement the automation would be cost-effective with our time until after we had a revenue stream to allow us some flexibility
0905031634<rszeno> also complicate, we must be all in sync someway
0905031729<rszeno> optimisation can be automated to some extent
0905031856<rszeno> i'm thinking to having a intermediate lang to describe what is done and why
0905031931<sirdancealot> wait wait what are we talking about now?
0905031932<rszeno> it will end with a repository of some sort
0905031939<stoopkid> lemon's lang is evolving into something that could be suitable for that
0905031955<rszeno> is ok
0905032146<rszeno> can you put it in a tech spec? we need for lerning lemon at first step also translation, etc..
0905032216<sirdancealot> tech spec?:)
0905032238<rszeno> a grammar and element desctription
0905032301<rszeno> a formalism is good too,:)
0905032336<sirdancealot> maybe i can finish some features and write a spec if i know for what purpose
0905032344<rszeno> should be plural, elements
0905032413<rszeno> writing arbitrary c code
0905032428<rszeno> purpose,^^^
0905032440<sirdancealot> ah hmmmm
0905032520<rszeno> pieces of c to do a given task
0905032550<sirdancealot> you want to parse and represent c with lemon?
0905032555<rszeno> with context, os, libs
0905032657<rszeno> not realy, i guess i have a better framework for this, but is only a guess
0905032741<rszeno> will be good to parse c and output lemon,:)
0905032750<stoopkid> hrm, i like where you're going with this, but i think that at the stage we're at now introducing anything like this as a way to coordinate ourselves would take time/energy away from that first goal of finding a source of revenue, and we don't have any projects to indicate to us what is really important to automate and what should be left to done manually in
          <stoopkid> order to reach financial success with this as quickly as possible, at which point we would hypothetically have that necessary knowledge and some financial flexibility to actually experiment
0905032847<stoopkid> at this stage it's administrative overhead without anything to administrate
0905032925<sirdancealot> parse c and output lemon..
0905032952<stoopkid> hrm i read that backwards the first time
0905033000<rszeno> all my life i avoided to work in teams mainly because i love to control what i do and when
0905033021<stoopkid> understandable
0905033050<sirdancealot> rszeno, it could help if you had your code available for us to see ..
0905033055<stoopkid> and then you find that although you have total control when you do that, you have total control over very little?
0905033142<rszeno> sirdancelot, sure but is perl
0905033214<stoopkid> what's this code?
0905033226<rszeno> stoopkid, you never have control in fact,:)
0905033227<sirdancealot> doesnt matter what lang
0905033330<rszeno> a kind of framwork for grammars is called zamolxe
0905033353<sirdancealot> i can write a definition of c in lemon, for parsing i might just use some python lib, would be simpler than buildin a c parser with my stuff
0905033530<rszeno> my idea is to have a perser generator, with zamolxe, in the reasoner
0905033613<rszeno> zamolxe was designed as being standalone
0905033652<rszeno> explaination:
0905033742<rszeno> you have a data source and language used by the source is unknown
0905033836<rszeno> all you must do is to describe the language, all the rest should be done automaticaly
0905033857<stoopkid> the rest of what
0905033908<sirdancealot> what kind of data, a c program?
0905033926<rszeno> whatever, communication, ...
0905033949<rszeno> let assume the data source is linkedin
0905034034<rszeno> what you want to do is not defined before you know the data source
0905034146<rszeno> when you know what you need is to collect information from linkedin and put in some place
0905034238<rszeno> when you decide you want for example "to grow number of your connection"
0905034350<rszeno> all you need is to describe the 'intention' and use the info you have to build a mechanism for that intention
0905034518<stoopkid> "all"
0905034527<sirdancealot> its a bit vague..
0905034550<stoopkid> that "all" seems to be describing pretty much the entirety of programming
0905034605<rszeno> yes, is vague and extensive
0905034654<rszeno> yes, include all programming stuff in fact,:)
0905034738<rszeno> both as category and details
0905034755<stoopkid> so, i assume the goal here is to make description of intention and building mechanisms for those intentions easier
0905034811<rszeno> distributed, concurrent
0905034832<rszeno> n3 for descriptions
0905034944<rszeno> all the logic and kb should be in n3, unfortulately i can't change this, is too late
0905035129<rszeno> logic doesn't matter as long you have a n3 model for it and a reasoner wich can process it without complaining about something
0905035204<stoopkid> hrm..
0905035316<sirdancealot> what cant you change?
0905035318<stoopkid> and what would the reasoner do? lang-to-lang translation?
0905035347<rszeno> having n3 for descriptions
0905035448<rszeno> unification only, proof by closure paths
0905035513<stoopkid> i'm not sure what the goal of the reasoning is though
0905035613<rszeno> in general or some specific case?
0905035652<rszeno> or simply "what is used for?"
0905035728<stoopkid> yea, we're putting everything into n3, but then what are we using that for
0905035929<rszeno> any intention is a local goal. Then we simply use the accumuated knowladge to rich the local goal
0905040101<rszeno> having all in n3 is just a decison, can be anything else but it mist fit the idea of "being good for description"
0905040154<stoopkid> hrm, i like the idea but it seems pretty far from market, unless you know something i don't wrt the market
0905040248<rszeno> is not for market is for you, me, parts of whatever we are,:)
0905040358<rszeno> the product of this can be for market, for example some generated code
0905040456<rszeno> can be used in a freelance contract for example
0905040519<stoopkid> hrm, so this would be a tool-set and common language for automating software dev tasks like code generation etc..?
0905040600<rszeno> yes, something like this
0905040637<rszeno> actualy a kind of system
0905040746<rszeno> one example: you can have a contract for security or administration
0905040901<rszeno> and the system will do the work because have the knowladge and the mechanism, the reasoner
0905041005<rszeno> the dificult part is to acumulate and clean the descriptions
0905041100<rszeno> need humans having domain knowladge
0905041126<rszeno> kind of supervised learning
0905041248<stoopkid> this sounds like something to work on after we've got a revenue stream and projects demonstrating to us specific things to automate, as otherwise we'd be working on it with no revenue stream, without any specific goal, and without the help of this software we'd be building. it's more of a long-term investment kind of thing
0905041346<rszeno> yes, is long term, i do this from '70,:)
0905041625<rszeno> it take me a lot  of time to realise that is nothing specific in AI, you have a goal only when you have a specific project
0905041739<rszeno> is all about methods of doing things not about things you do
0905041924<rszeno> the thing we do must encode this methods only
0905041946<rszeno> and use them rarely
0905042216<rszeno> for example trail and error: just choose something decent and see results
0905042451<stoopkid> hrm, i don't see any of this leading to a revenue stream though except for in the long term if we actually invested the time/energy to design & build something like this up to the point that it actually makes dev more efficient rather than just siphoning time/energy away from working directly on projects
0905042503<rszeno> takeing decison is a logic process but the task also involve classification and a lot of previous knowledge and decisopns
0905042640<rszeno> time is a powerfull resource, if you can have it for other goals them rutine
0905042821<stoopkid> unfortunately at this point my only goal can be to get directly to a source of money as quickly as possible, and leave everything else to be worked on afterwards
0905042845<rszeno> freelance
0905042901<rszeno> it saved me few times
0905042934<rszeno> try freelance.org
0905042939<stoopkid> yea that's my best bet to keep me afloat until i can get a full-time job that can make ends meet
0905043016<rszeno> you don't need a full job,:)
0905043046<stoopkid> well, w/e job that makes ends meet, if i can pay all my bills freelance i'd never do anything else
0905043210<rszeno> if you can use paypal i have $60 there, now
0905043601<sirdancealot> i dont think that solves stoopkid's life situation..:)
0905043711<rszeno> no but is a temporar solution
0905044329<sirdancealot> stoopkid, like we talked about, if you find some work for two, i can find time to put in
0905044408<rszeno> three, not only two,:)
0905044430<sirdancealot> good
0905044509<sirdancealot> ive lowered my standards lately...
0905044519<sirdancealot> im particularly curious about java
0905044538<sirdancealot> dunno how its in the US but here java and js are the best paying
0905044558<sirdancealot> apparently
0905044623<rszeno> i'm good with js not good with java,:)
0905044634<stoopkid> it's probably about the same in the US
0905044649<rszeno> mobile market need java
0905044740<rszeno> i have somebody on linkedin doing this
0905044805<rszeno> Bidhuna Babu, is indian
0905044825<stoopkid> i guess i should have some kind of existence in social media
0905044841<sirdancealot> at elektroline my next task is supposed to be a Qt app https://www.qt.io/mobile-app-development/
0905044844<rszeno> join linkedin
0905044916<sirdancealot> the plan is a desktop app and possibly later mobile
0905045011<rszeno> it look like they already do mobile
0905045519<stoopkid> alright i'm gonna start off getting myself set up on linkedin and facebook and all that and getting a website set up for us to market with, unless somebody's already got one they want to use?
0905045615<stoopkid> sirdancealot: i'd need to learn qt but i'd be down to work on that if there's enough work for two
0905045626<rszeno> we are both on likedin, i'm not on facebook
0905045646<rszeno> qt like gtk is a mess
0905045712<sirdancealot> website, what for?
0905045748<rszeno> https://www.qt.io/download/
0905045804<stoopkid> market for software dev work, particularly web dev
0905045832<rszeno> webgl, another mess
0905045921<rszeno> $79/month
0905045936<sirdancealot> stoopkid, i dont a website is needed or even desirable these days for chasing jobs
0905045941<sirdancealot> rszeno, for what?
0905050001<rszeno> qt.io said this
0905050025<sirdancealot> licensing?
0905050031<rszeno> i have no idea what for.
0905050044<rszeno> possible
0905050121<rszeno> see bottom of the link i posted
0905050126<rszeno> https://www.qt.io/download/
0905050135<sirdancealot> Commercial license without GPL/LGPL obligations*
0905050211<rszeno> probably
0905050239<rszeno> i wander how
0905050256<sirdancealot> how what?
0905050319<rszeno> gpl obligation
0905050408<rszeno> are not something arbitrar, are inside the licence
0905050509<sirdancealot> stoopkid, whats your city again?
0905050523<sirdancealot> rszeno, ?
0905050532<rszeno> Timisoara
0905050601<rszeno> i'm near, in a vilage, Giroc
0905050640<sirdancealot> rszeno, the question mark was for the gpl stuff, but ok:)
0905050704<rszeno> aha, :)
0905050734<stoopkid> sirdancealot: baltimore
0905050810<rszeno> gpl say something about preserving licence with propriteary transfer
0905050847<rszeno> is from what i recall but we could check
0905050940<sirdancealot> hm hm
0905050953<rszeno> doesn't matter untill we are involved somehow,:)
0905051015<stoopkid> the website isn't really for marketing myself on the angle of being a prospective employee to some employer, it's for the angle of marketing myself (or this team) as a service to prospective clients, which i think is a better angle for freelance especially for a team working internationally
0905051158<rszeno> wait, which website?
0905051207<sirdancealot> well, as you wish
0905051258<rszeno> w3c.org, :)
0905051355<stoopkid> just a site to describe my services and showcase work, nothing special
0905051449<rszeno> chose hosting, dns and just build a page on it
0905051542<stoopkid> yep
0905051546<rszeno> let me know the url to help with spreading it
0905051616<sirdancealot> stoopkid, as on the elektroline stuff, my contract is gonna be for $7.8/hour, but we can try
0905051626<rszeno> if you join linkedin put the link in profile
0905051728<rszeno> 7.8 or 7... 8?
0905051736<sirdancealot> point
0905051847<sirdancealot> or thats the pessimistic expectation
          <rszeno> ok, then first, i'm just curious how time you need to become rich,:)
0905051915<rszeno> is over $50 a day
0905051934<sirdancealot> its crap
0905051936<rszeno> 8 hours
0905051946<sirdancealot> they openly admit they are trying to screw me over
0905051953<rszeno> yes, is low but usual
0905052032<rszeno> almost everybody pay poor
0905052053<sirdancealot> all the good offers are js and java..
0905052111<rszeno> both are easy
0905052120<sirdancealot> yeah
0905052220<rszeno> well, java is a mess probably is something difficult in it
0905052333<rszeno> jean mark need a java or scala developer but i don't know if he pay
0905052400<rszeno> scala is beter then java anyway
0905052404<sirdancealot> he doesnt seem to talk lately:)
0905052450<rszeno> yes, he have some contracts, guvernamental or so, so is busy
0905052452<sirdancealot> scala would be worth learning too i suppose
0905052508<rszeno> is easy
0905052525<rszeno> i already use it
0905052557<rszeno> but it still have same roots,:)
0905052620<rszeno> all will end to oracle,:)
0905052631<rszeno> js, java, scala
0905052751<rszeno> scala had a good start but was messed by building library for it
0905052820<sirdancealot> those damn libraries mess everything up
0905052847<stoopkid> good offers for .NET at least here in the US
0905052859<sirdancealot> yeah
0905052903<stoopkid> i guess we're a heavily microsoft-oriented country
0905052917<sirdancealot> nah its here too
0905053009<rszeno> and here too
0905053057<rszeno> india, china, almost everywhere
0905053158<rszeno> when is not ms is android
0905053435<rszeno> .net work on linux i guess
0905053446<sirdancealot> ya
0905053450<rszeno> never tryed
0905053500<stoopkid> as far as database work i mostly see stuff for enterprise database software that i'm not familiar with, db2 and such
0905053548<rszeno> sqlite or perl?
0905053637<rszeno> db2 look like they use perl
0905053823<rszeno> linux there?
0905053938<rszeno> try fille, will tell you
0905053947<stoopkid> yea most jobs i've looked at were asking at least for comfortability with linux
0905054210<rszeno> is good, i didn't seen windows since 2000, befor
0905054330<sirdancealot> yeah
0905054645<stoopkid> wrt the marketable skills/experience that i've got along the lines of the stuff we've listed out here, it's mostly just LAMP + HTML/CSS/JS, decent capacity for design including graphic design for web (though i really need to refine and professionalize my skills there), some experience with Java but no comprehensive knowledge of it for sure, and that's about
0905054646<stoopkid> it, though i don't think i'd have much problem filling in the gaps with my Java knowledge, expanding my web-dev skills to android & IOS app-dev, and i'm ready & willing to start diving into anything that people are paying money for
0905054730<stoopkid> i've got plenty other dev skills, but i classify them as "far from market"
0905054826<stoopkid> like, i didn't see any job listings for agda, n3 or prolog :)
0905054837<stoopkid> or prog-lang design
0905054904<stoopkid> or math, at least not anything i've got the credentials for
0905054906<sirdancealot> it depends
0905054950<sirdancealot> i think if you go stalking specific companies, you might find a job more appropriate for your interests
0905054951<rszeno> this are high skills, very rare
0905055039<rszeno> quality asurance, six sigma
0905055040<stoopkid> true, wrt stalking companies
0905055128<sirdancealot> ya i should take my own advice here
0905055142<sirdancealot> whats six sigma?
0905055201<rszeno> a method in qa
0905055303<rszeno> in last years i worked in some weird fields like qa and security
0905055314<stoopkid> i'm definitely on the look-out for things more appealing to my interests & the skill-set i've been working to develop, but, that market is still tiny today, i need to hedge my bet there with something more standard like web/app dev
          <rszeno> managment
0905055408<rszeno> yes web/app will usualy work
0905055502<sirdancealot> https://www.jetbrains.com/company/jobs/
0905055537<rszeno> market is a little full of it but they stll need it because what you find are poor skilled
0905055621<stoopkid> pretty much every biz needs a website and now most of them are starting to want apps as well, and yea it's a market flooded with non-programmers because of the misconception that web-dev is somehow "easier programming"
0905055758<rszeno> is not and is hard because is multi-disciplinar
0905055829<rszeno> to many different things in a single place
0905055907<stoopkid> indeed, that's why i learned the full stack
0905055945<rszeno> jetbrain - only two with effective work
0905060010<sirdancealot> ?
0905060017<stoopkid> only two devs?
0905060019<rszeno> what the hell is a campus ambassador?
0905060032<sirdancealot> marketing
0905060037<rszeno> yes, the rest are managers
0905060049<sirdancealot> ah:)
0905060052<rszeno> kind off
0905060059<stoopkid> i see
0905060155<stoopkid> yea you don't necessarily need a lot of devs to get a lot done, koo and i blaze through things with our pair programming stuff when we have a clear picture of what we're doing
0905060216<rszeno> 'Campus Ambassadors are community leaders opening up this opportunity to their university peers."
0905060233<rszeno> why they need this?
0905060254<sirdancealot> because people that go to university are dumb
0905060302<stoopkid> :)
0905060330<rszeno> yes, it seems so
0905060339<sirdancealot> at least jetbrains doesnt push it from preschool like microsoft
0905060354<sirdancealot> *since
0905060405<rszeno> :)
0905060440<rszeno> to much energy on advertising
0905060519* stoopkid shrugs
0905060522<rszeno> "They share information about JetBrains tools and                                             demonstrate their benefits and advantages. Dozens of students at MFF already                                             use JetBrains tools, and others join every month."
0905060611<stoopkid> if you advertise something to the extent that people perceive it as "the option", then they'll buy it
0905060617<stoopkid> regardless of its quality
0905060657<rszeno> and throw when they can't use it,:)
0905060732<rszeno> in the end is a flow of money
0905060858<rszeno> that "critical thinking" is missing, imo
0905061000<rszeno> maybe is better, everybody will live in the end
0905061021<stoopkid> the thing is, a company focused on making money isn't focused on making quality software, they're focused on making profitable software for short-term returns so that they can use that money to go make even more money
0905061107<rszeno> yes, i know


0905061116<stoopkid> quality software might be what lasts, but the person making money doesn't care, cause they last too, they just end up changing what it is they're doing with their money
0905061531<stoopkid> consumers generally don't hold any individuals in a company accountable for bad software, so the company sticks around, changes hands, and people who made money move around doing different things with their money because consumers will still buy it because they aren't aware enough of the details of the industry to realize that these people moving around just
          <stoopkid> looking for short-term profits are what's the main cause of low-quality software, let alone to realize who they are
0905061621<stoopkid> so, since working purely for short-term profits at the expense of quality is tolerated, it's the standard, since that's the fastest way to getting into a position for even more short-term profits
0905061654* stoopkid shrugs
0905061723<stoopkid> that's what we're up against if we choose to operate in any alternative way
0905061729<rszeno> in the end money is what everybody need
0905061801<stoopkid> yep
0905061905<rszeno> i have somebody on linkedin who sell couses to live on mars
0905061925<rszeno> cources
0905061940<rszeno> lessons, kind of
0905062003<rszeno> he worked for nasa
0905062036<stoopkid> that'd probably useful to know how to survive on the highly possible future post-apocalyptic earth
          <rszeno> probably have no job now
0905062045<stoopkid> probably be*
0905062144<rszeno> yes but is a very small chance to learn this,:)

0905062405<rszeno> how i see this, is hard to find a job, sound like a apocliptic earh already
0905062523<rszeno> are a lot of linkedin
0905062544<rszeno> world wide
0905062623<stoopkid> there's plenty of work for skilled techies, and they're putting everybody else out of work :)
0905062729<rszeno> usualy jobs offers doesn't fit with work offers
0905062745<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
0905062755<stoopkid> ah
          <rszeno> the problem is in timing
0905062829<stoopkid> it's a world-wide social problem
0905062908<rszeno> they look for people but are busy, when they doesn't look are free
0905063014<rszeno> i'm on linkedin now, :)
0905063203<rszeno> is a mess, invention of web is a mess,:)
0905063230<rszeno> bad decison, bad implementation
0905063343<stoopkid> imo the problem is that the way the typical labor arrangement works today doesn't put most laborers in a position to know how to actually participate in the economy except with specific request and instruction from a company, because they have no understanding of the other side, and likewise companies, executives & managers are understanding laborers less
          <stoopkid> and less
0905063443<rszeno> yes, like always, communication is missing
0905063633<stoopkid> also, in the US, the media and society in general gears the labor class to not think about this stuff, and just think about their job when they're at the job, and think about nothing to do with work when they're not at the job and just have fun instead, which leaves little or no time/energy for critical assessment of one's socioeconomic situation
0905063833<rszeno> people will do whatever they need doesn't matter what media say
0905063944<stoopkid> this sort of paints a picture of why there's a communication breakdown though, neither side is even really thinking about each other and what the other side needs, they're just looking at what they can take from each other, and the labor class is just getting less and less skilled at participating in the economy controlled by the companies
0905064106<stoopkid> in the US for example, most people only see a very very small range of rigid options, created for them by companies
0905064149<rszeno> this is probably everywhere
0905064307<rszeno> nobody care what you know but what they need
0905064411<rszeno> i have a friend, if funny, is professor
0905064500<rszeno> he learn to programm CNC is a language used by Fanuc
0905064609<rszeno> the funny part is that nobody use the language but he learn his students to use it,:)
0905064732<rszeno> have no utility in the end, is probably some personal revange that he learn it
0905064755<stoopkid> sounds like the majority of math education today
0905064835<rszeno> well you still have chances to use math,:)
0905064853<stoopkid> true
0905064933<stoopkid> it's at least a 0.00001% chance of ever using it rather than just 0% chance
0905064952<rszeno> yes,:)
0905065034<rszeno> are some groups of math on linkedin, i'm member,:)
0905065259<stoopkid> so, wrt splitting up work, i think we'd probably want to split that up according to our skills/experience/interest/time
0905065352<rszeno> i'm very bad with graphics
0905065420<stoopkid> like graphic design & multi-media?
0905065442<rszeno> yes
0905065515<stoopkid> i'm alright with that stuff, on web at least, and i know koo's got some skills there as well
0905065537<rszeno> except multi-media can be about code to wrap video, i'v done this
0905065627<rszeno> perl, php, js, can count on this from me
0905065730<rszeno> actualy less php, last time i did was more then few years ago
0905065758<rszeno> but i was a kind of expert,:)
0905065900<rszeno> was not me saying this but a lot of peoples on javascript.com, forum
0905065944<stoopkid> php and js from me as well, i've got a bit of experience with perl but would need to refresh, it's been years since i've used it
0905070016<rszeno> kind of expert on js to but were few better then me, authors of books and many years of experience
0905070052<rszeno> yes, probably i need refresh too
0905070125<stoopkid> well i guess you're our js guy then :)
0905070210<rszeno> ok, jquery too but what i know is pretty old
0905070302<stoopkid> jquery's great, is it not under active development anymore?
0905070317<rszeno> i have no idea
0905070340<rszeno> i didn't watch it
0905070401<stoopkid> ah woops i misread that, i read it as "i know that it's pretty old"
0905070452<rszeno> well when i worked with it was at a low version,:)
0905070531<stoopkid> i've worked it not too long ago, it's still just as good as always
0905070539<stoopkid> worked with it*
0905070656<rszeno> i never worked with their UI, not for a client i mean, what i did was just to try it
0905070809<rszeno> i suppose i can learn any framework used today but i didn't have any motivation
0905070928<stoopkid> i pretty much always use it when i work on web, it smooths out all the ad-hocness and makes it easier to maintain a design that works in all browsers (though it's not a magic bullet)
0905071046<rszeno> was easy for me to build what i need with dom and js or php/perl
0905071238<rszeno> in general i always avoided frameworks. they look like new names for same task and full of exploits
0905071323<rszeno> probably jquery was the cleanest
0905071431<rszeno> i don't know what is new now on the market
0905071502<rszeno> i seen offer for angular js
0905071601<rszeno> now i'm reading about neutrino, a exploit kit
0905071636<rszeno> seems their target is Magento
0905071704<stoopkid> well, jquery can't do anything that dom and js can't do already, but it's a good clean lang design, like, all the places you would think "it should work like this", it usually does work like that, and imo it's at the logical next level of abstraction beyond js/dom, so i find it preferable to working directly at the basic dom manipulation commands which are
          <stoopkid> pretty ad-hoc and don't come with nearly the same kind of support for complex manipulations that jquery provides very cleanly

0905071739<stoopkid> idk what's new on the market, and jquery is the only js framework i'm really familiar with, but from what i've seen on job listings it's still a desired skill
0905071826<rszeno> was and is probably still good
0905071917<rszeno> btw, i don't have experience with node but is not hard
0905072028<rszeno> i'v done something for server side for me, actualy i was ported a js thing from geko
0905072045<rszeno> few scripts
0905072046<stoopkid> me neither really but i've looked at it and it just seems like the same old js in some server-side packaging, which i don't think i'd have a problem with
0905072113<rszeno> yes seems easy
0905072214<rszeno> some of rdf stuff is in node

0905073813<stoopkid> hrm, i'm not credentialed at all and don't have much prior finished work to show for myself so i think that would limit my ability to land any work involving stuff like kb & reasoners even if i was able to perform the job, though i know it's out there if i stalked companies like koo was saying

0905074415<stoopkid> this time i'm just gonna start doing the web dev regardless of what other work i find, so that it'll always at least be there on the side

0905074830<stoopkid> i've dealt with this, they have unrealistic expectations, it's up to the employee or freelancer to get them back to reality and settle on a solution where everybody profits
0905074851*** Quit: kookoochoo3 (~kookoocho@37-48-14-36.tmcz.cz) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 265 seconds
0905075007<stoopkid> and it's easier to do this marketing yourself as a freelancer/company/service rather than a potential employee, where the employer expects it to be a "do what i tell you" rather than a "what can you do for me" kind of relationship
0905075030<rszeno> i used to achive their goals only, not what they said thei want
0905075116<rszeno> "i want a php site". :)
0905075210<rszeno> is pretty wierd
0905075326<rszeno> 'i want to be on first page in google search" is closer
0905075417<stoopkid> yea, SEO's a huge market that i'm not familiar with
0905075439<rszeno> i am
0905075503<rszeno> was the main task there
0905075610<rszeno> is easy, not so hard as it seems
0905075822<rszeno> i brought thei site in first few links on first page
0905075840<stoopkid> are you good with security, networking and/or scalable systems? if so i think we'd have a pretty serious web dev team just between the 3 of us
0905075934<rszeno> yes, but hosting on linux only
0905080014<stoopkid> hrm, yea i'm pretty much a linux-only guy too, as far as skills/experience goes
0905080018<rszeno> i have no idea what a window server require for sec or network
0905080110<rszeno> we can llearn but this require time
0905080147<rszeno> so i said only what i can do now
0905080259<stoopkid> hrm i think all 3 of us are mostly linux-only at this point, cuts us out of the microsoft and apple markets for back-end work, which is a pretty major dent, and yea it'd take time to get familiar with that
0905080350<stoopkid> but, with the skillsets we have between us we could at least take on serious medium-largish web projects on linux
0905080450<rszeno> like being IT for somebody?:)
0905080545<stoopkid> whatever they're paying for
0905080616<rszeno> we probably can do admininstration too but is poor pay
0905080758<rszeno> tcl/tk here if they need
0905080845<rszeno> actualy is more but we can pretend we do too much
0905080944<rszeno> once i count with a friend, i worked in over 100 languages
0905081042<rszeno> some was realy weird,
0905081143<rszeno> anyway, usa market is better then EU
0905081255<stoopkid> the market on jobs.com in the US is almost entirely for defense contractors and major financial institutions
0905081338<stoopkid> freelance.com will probably be better on my conscience :)
0905081424<rszeno> probably, is about bringing money in the end
0905081512<rszeno> i have no idea where is freelance.org located
0905081531<rszeno> but doesn't mater
0905081854<stoopkid> yep. so, the big money comes from the governments, the big banks and the big companies, until you own a product that changes your role and brings the money in from consumers. that's why i spend most of my time these days stalking these institutions. as far as profits go, the way to make them is to watch in detail how these institutions are spending and
          <stoopkid> position oneself to be ready to take on that job when they're ready to drop that money
0905081956<stoopkid> online payment gateways are a huge one, probably the huge one, if there is any to single out

0905092733<rszeno> is his product, a kind of editor/reasoner
0905092811<rszeno> well not a reasoner in my opinion but he say it is,:)

0905093202<rszeno> what he do now is a kind of search ( virtuso )
0905093223<rszeno> anyway is a good tool
0905093408<stoopkid> will be a while before we'd have your tool though, not to mention profits from it, even if we got started on it immediately, but i'm down to work on long-term investments like that
0905093530<stoopkid> but, in the meantime i'd have to work it around the main thing i need to focus on which is short-term returns
0905093602<rszeno> probably will take time to finish it
0905093759<rszeno> is not a problem
0905093837<rszeno> i cook this from 40 years already
0905093920<rszeno> is huge anyway

0905094140<rszeno> i mean the tool will  work toghether with us,:)
0905094213<stoopkid> best to just work incrementally imo, trial and error like you said, preferably based on specific dev problems resulting from real projects that could be solved by automation
0905094243<rszeno> yes
0905094327<rszeno> but is a huge step anyway
0905094415<rszeno> all this years i just learn what i need
0905094537<rszeno> who know if all toghther will work
0905094805<stoopkid> so how familiar are you with type theory frameworks like idris/agda/coq?
0905094940<rszeno> prety wll with type theory
0905095013<rszeno> almost nine with the rest
0905095029<rszeno> none, i mean
0905095105<rszeno> coq a little
0905095125<stoopkid> idris, agda and coq are really just computer implementations of dependent type theory
0905095146<stoopkid> this is the way to go as far as provers and formal specifications go, imo
0905095244<rszeno> i have idris and agda installed, is not what i expect
0905095311<rszeno> i have hol and coq instaled too
0905095335<rszeno> closer to what i think is metamath
0905095420<rszeno> is pretty primitive but is more clear
0905095443<stoopkid> i haven't tried hol, but idris and agda are basically just like haskell extended with dependent types, and coq is also just haskell with dependent types but it's harder to tell because they use a tactics language for their proofs/programs rather than direct lambda-calculus expressions in haskell syntax like idris and agda do
0905095556<stoopkid> haskell + dependent types basically makes a theorem and proof framework for constructive higher-order predicate logic
0905095635<stoopkid> coq is entirely oriented as a proof framework, agda and idris on the other hand are geared more as programming languages, like haskell
0905095640<rszeno> dpendent types are complex in the end typing is a nightmair
0905095702<stoopkid> dependent types aren't any more complex than "forall" and "there exists"
0905095743<rszeno> hol can work with omega from lambda cube
0905095815<stoopkid> what do you mean work with?
0905095909<rszeno> the formalism once you chose it must be used someway
0905095924<rszeno> hol can do this
0905095957<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
0905100026<rszeno> proofs, deductions, all the stuff you need
0905100121<rszeno> and preserve truth when it work, aka avoid logical traps
0905100223<rszeno> https://cakeml.org/
0905100226<stoopkid> i'm looking over it now, just looks like some flavor of dependently typed lambda calculus to me
0905100252<rszeno> take a look to cakeml
0905100302* stoopkid checking it out
0905100324<rszeno> is a interesting work
0905100357<rszeno> proofs for coq and hol written in cakeml
0905100446<rszeno> actualy i like acl2 but ...
0905100640<rszeno> magnus myreen is behind milawa
0905100734<stoopkid> the nice thing about dependent type theory frameworks is that they integrate the ability to express arbitrarily sophisticated mathematical objects within the framework of a programming language. if i want to express a type of mathematical groups, or rings, or fields, then in dependent type theory i just write out the axioms of these structures in a type, and
          <stoopkid> it's done
0905100805<stoopkid> in C++ or other lesser languages it's hard for me to imagine what kind of hoops you'd have to jump through to get that kind of functionality cleanly
0905100821<stoopkid> i'd probably just use the C++ to write a dependent type theory framework... :)
0905100848<rszeno> why i should choose dependent types when i can chose anything in the cube? :)
0905100943<stoopkid> well, i don't suggest to *only* use dependent types, there's a whole cube of dependencies to work with, dependent types included
0905101017<rszeno> yes, this is the cube in the end,:)
0905101109<rszeno> depending on problem you can chose what is simple and clar, :)
0905101202<rszeno> actualy i'm not sure if something given have any chance to work
0905101326<rszeno> solving, how can be solved, depend of problem in the end
0905101436<rszeno> anyway the theory is too abstract in the end
0905101443<stoopkid> type theory?
0905101458<rszeno> no, lambda cube
0905101529<rszeno> there is the computational key in the end
0905101604<rszeno> depend types is only a part of the problem
0905101624<stoopkid> hrm, i don't find it to be too abstract
0905101712<rszeno> depend of who are talking
0905101737<rszeno> is too complex for most programmers
0905101744<stoopkid> i agree that most people probably find it too abstract but that doesn't have much to do with building a good reasoner :)
0905101848<rszeno> is hard to make something practical from it
0905101915<rszeno> anyway the reasoner is probably simple
0905101928<rszeno> is just a unifier
0905101944<stoopkid> maybe the way i'd explain it: i see full-cube systems as being essentially mathematical assembly language
0905102031<stoopkid> they give full correspondence to predicate logic, but no mathematicians actually work directly in predicate logic, that's assembly language that they've built higher-level languages over
0905102153<stoopkid> this is why i'm really interested in these frameworks but at the same time don't have much illusions about their current marketability
0905102307<rszeno> is probably a little more complex because each part of the cube explore what you can do when you have an atribute
0905102340<stoopkid> sure, i mostly just restrict my focus to systems like agda/idris/coq where all 3 attributes are in play
0905102408<stoopkid> i.e. the opposite corner from the simply typed lambda calc
0905102424<rszeno> http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/cl/cl017.htm
0905102429<stoopkid> calculus of (inductive) constructions
0905102444<rszeno> probably the best description
0905102511<stoopkid> heh that was one of my main references when i was learning about it (is in the topic in #zennet)
0905102529<stoopkid> yea he gives a very straight-forward explanation
0905102534<rszeno> ski is almost perfect for optimisations
0905102616<stoopkid> why's that?
0905102625<rszeno> ski?
0905102648<stoopkid> yea i'm not familiar with it's suitability for opitmization

0905102916<rszeno> then Curry continue or restarted the work
0905103022<rszeno> is in fact same thing but from another point of view
0905103109<rszeno> i didn't heard of Nock since now
0905103117<stoopkid> isn't anything turing-complete the same thing from a different point of view?
0905103241<rszeno> it is but the problem is what you can chew in the end
0905103252<stoopkid> true :)

0905103435<rszeno> if we can translate something from english to a logical epresion and do something with it is like we only did something
0905103551<rszeno> but translation and what we do with the expression is only our simple way to do this,:)
0905103647<stoopkid> alright i guess since you've got familiarity with this stuff and the demonstrated experience with reasoner systems, then i can include work involving type theory systems in my search as well (not that i'm expecting to find much)
0905103719<rszeno> yes,
0905103754<rszeno> my intention is to build a kind of framework
0905103929<rszeno> i don't see why can be used with dependent types and in general with any uninvented yet theory in general
0905104031<stoopkid> computers are computers and algorithms are algorithms when it comes down to it
0905104032<rszeno> as i said, is about methods not things
0905104053<rszeno> yes
0905104143<rszeno> once you can do primitive things anything else is just a combination,:)
0905104339<stoopkid> well, i guess the next steps for me are to start doing a more serious search for sources of money, now that i know who's gonna be involved and in what capacity
0905104440<rszeno> for project?
0905104512<stoopkid> yea
0905104638<rszeno> freelance, is a independent source and we can prove to ourself that wat is done will work
0905104736<rszeno> or we can build a company or something and use the tool for work,:)
0905104803<stoopkid> indeed, that's more or less what i have in mind here if we could pull that off
0905104942<rszeno> yes, if will fail we can stop it without any delivery expectation or something
0905105100<rszeno> is still a lot of learning we need

0905192248<stoopkid> editable-koo: yo
0905194337<stoopkid> alright wrt splitting up work, i'm gonna focus on web/app dev, payment gateway interface, financing, accounting, marketing and market research
0905201551<editable-koo>hehe
0905201747<editable-koo>had a shitty day at work
0905201825<editable-koo>boss wanted me to "fix" something while i kept maintaining it would complicate things
0905201915<editable-koo>long story short i still have to fix everything up now
0905201959<editable-koo>but thats supposedly the end of the task
0905202116<editable-koo>so, jul 28 first day at the job
0905202138<editable-koo>sep 6 done
0905202153<editable-koo>30 or maaaaaybe 35 kczk
0905202323<editable-koo>so, lets say thats 25k/month
0905202413<editable-koo>and now their offer is 30k/month for full time, 36k after 3 months
0905202420<stoopkid> whats that in $?
0905202425<editable-koo>no czk
0905202442<stoopkid> no i mean how much would that be in $
0905202446<editable-koo>ah
0905202452<editable-koo>/24
0905202527<editable-koo>$1000/month
0905202612<editable-koo>but the confusing part is..
0905202701<editable-koo>he says its up to me to decide if i want a half-time or 3/4 time or whatever contract
0905202743<editable-koo>and im like, i dunno, ive definitely not been working full time this month, maybe a 3/4
0905202830<editable-koo>and he's like...no reaction
0905202904<editable-koo>and im like...scratch head, can we sign this as a full-time and ill keep working like this?
0905202929<editable-koo>is he trying to see how much work he can squeeze from me?
0905202953<stoopkid> yes & yes
0905203010<stoopkid> well, the first yes if he'd accept that
0905203045<editable-koo>another factor is my disability pension, it might be good for me to not go for more than half-time employment oficially
0905203106<editable-koo>yea well hmm
0905203132<stoopkid> you said that was around $600/mo or so?
0905203300<editable-koo>the new offer is 30(36)/mo so a half would be 15(18)
0905203403<stoopkid> so your disability pension is already covering around half the pay you'd get if you were working full-time anyway, so yea, might as well just stick to half-time if it would affect your pension
0905203500<stoopkid> maybe if that was like 60/mo it would be worth it, but, i don't see any gain in working full-time just to get the same income you would at half-time
0905203506<editable-koo>the pension is 9500czk/mo now, if i work half-time they'll eventually cut it down to 5kczk/mo
0905203528<stoopkid> hrm
0905203544<editable-koo>and if i work full time theyll cut it completely, unless i dress this as contract work
0905203645<editable-koo>and adjust the hours
0905203705<editable-koo>as i see folks around me doing
0905203830<stoopkid> would your boss go for that?
0905203910<editable-koo>he didnt seem happy about that idea
0905203933<stoopkid> did he say why?
0905204021<editable-koo>said i kept pushing them into a corner, he didnt get a chance to answer why and we didnt go back to it
0905204120* stoopkid shrugs
0905204127<editable-koo>im thinking maybe we could keep the current arrangement, which is a kind of contract work with some hour limit
0905204140<editable-koo>i have no idea tho
0905204213<editable-koo>im just trying to make a fair deal with them, but im totally confused
0905204214<stoopkid> if it's a kind of contract work maybe it wouldn't affect your disability pension? or have you checked into that
0905204258<editable-koo>yeah the contract work as ive been doing it now is easy to write the hours low and the rate high
0905204421<editable-koo>i told him id rather keep working task-based, and he was like uuuh thats dificult i dont even know if we can do that
0905204442<editable-koo>he wants me to sit there
0905204448<editable-koo>but he doesnt say how long
0905204532<stoopkid> is this on-site work or are you doing it from home?
0905204536<editable-koo>and says nobody will count hours
0905204553<editable-koo>its both, more on-site
0905204727<editable-koo>i suppose if my next task is again a separate project from their main line of work, i can keep working partly from home
0905204801<editable-koo>might be even less need for communication than on the testing framework
0905205056<stoopkid> hrm, probably just have to be patient with them wrt settling down on an employment arrangment that works for everybody, my experience is that most employers are pretty reasonable but only after you've really convinced them it's worth it to even bother thinking about it rather than just continuing with the current arrangements
0905205534<stoopkid> like, there's really only two reasons i can see that they wouldn't go for it, either they can pay you less under the current arrangements or it'd just be more legal & administrative overhead than they feel like dealing with
0905205602<stoopkid> (to switch up the arrangements, that is)
0905205808<editable-koo>i guess im gonna have to talk about it with someone else there than the "boss"
0905205826<editable-koo>i call him the boss but he's just a senior dev or something
0905205831<editable-koo>http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Czech+Republic&country2=United+States&city1=Prague&city2=Baltimore%2C+MD&tracking=getDispatchComparison
0905210005<stoopkid> so on average things cost about twice as much and people earn a bit less than twice as much, if i'm reading this chart right
0905210046<editable-koo>i cant find the earning side of things
0905210209<editable-koo>ah average salary
0905210212<stoopkid> hrm actually salaries are over 3 times as high
0905210250<stoopkid> i was looking at purchasing power, i guess that's a ratio of salary to average cost of goods
0905210500<stoopkid> yea, that is what that is
0905210513<editable-koo>at any case it doesnt seem to make sense that i'd split my local work with you
0905210521<stoopkid> ah
0905210535<stoopkid> yea wouldn't make much sense
0905210549<stoopkid> should be the other way around if anything
0905210555<editable-koo>yea
0905210659<editable-koo>probably best if you acted as a company or something there
0905210830<stoopkid> yea that would make sense, i guess i should start studying up on what's required to start an LLC
0905210855<editable-koo>hehe
0905212339<stoopkid> ok yea i'm just gonna start by getting that website set up and my friend's gonna help me set up an LLC
0905212618<stoopkid> and he's a real-estate agent who needs a portfolio site, said he's gonna pay me to set one up at some point and i'm having him stay on the look-out for projects for me since he's always networking
0905212755<stoopkid> there's some other people i'm gonna talk to about that as well, none of them are software devs but i think they could probably find us a decent amount of work if we cut them in with finders fees
0905212921<stoopkid> if anyone was gonna focus on recruiting i think that'd be rszeno
0905213315<stoopkid> there's really only a couple other specialties we'd need to fully round off our team here though, so, i'm not worried too much about recruiting
0905213404<editable-koo>you mean recruiting more work force?
0905213411<stoopkid> right
0905213453<editable-koo>maybe some of your #collaborate contacts?
0905213605<stoopkid> true, i know at least a few of them were willing to work for free on a pretty sophisticated project
0905213634<stoopkid> but, i haven't talked to most of them in a while, i think their interest fizzled out
0905213705<stoopkid> maybe the prospect of payment would rekindle that interest though
0905214047<stoopkid> i'll bring it up to them later when i can formulate my thoughts a bit better
0905214258<stoopkid> alright i guess if i'm gonna be doing web-dev i should start collecting reference web-sites and making feature check-lists
0905214527<editable-koo>feature check-lists?:)
0905214711<stoopkid> yea, lists of every feature you'd expect to see on a web-site so that i can prepare and make sure i can efficiently incorporate any of these into a web-site design on demand
0905214841<editable-koo>alright
0905215003<stoopkid> i'd probably do the same for any kind of system where there's a set of standard features, but i've been meaning to do it for web for years and never really made it too far with it due to finding other work and stopping
0905215100<stoopkid> and i wish i had done it years ago cause the standard feature-set for web hasn't changed much at all
0905215147<stoopkid> maybe a greater degree of social media and app integration, but, just more not different
0905215404<stoopkid> yea i'm kind of anally formulaic, i admit this.. but, it works for me. i struggled with RDFS for months until i made a check-list and then we handled the whole thing minus a couple details in just a couple days after that
0905215722<stoopkid> anyway, the main big thing for contract software work that actually pays well is gonna be biz/finance software. ERP, CRM, payment gateway interface, database analysis which will often be market analysis, etc...
0905215839<editable-koo>sounds fun
0905215846<stoopkid> there's other big things, but, this one is especially permanent and universal
0905215848<editable-koo>what kind of checklist did you make for rdfs?
0905215937<stoopkid> every single detail that had to be implemented
0905220039<stoopkid> which was mostly just listing out every single pred or keyword and writing out a description for it in a document that was easier to work with than the actual specs
0905220116<stoopkid> (particularly a document where i had the ability to color-code everything according to its state of completion, or provide other indicators of the state of everything)
0905220142<stoopkid> i think you saw that document, i remember you commenting on the color-coding
0905220327<stoopkid> anyway, after i made the check-list, i had the assurance that there was nothing to look into besides what was on that check-list, and any time i was wondering what to do next, i just picked something colored as incomplete and worked a bit more on it, and within a couple days we had just about the whole document colored as complete
0905220434<stoopkid> check-list works every time, as long as it's actually an important check-list that you're dedicated to maintaining and completing
0905221118<stoopkid> a bit later down the road i've got a vague idea to combine git, editable-log and lemon into a system to keep track of everything done on a project
0905231807*** Join: rszeno (~rszeno@79.114.73.164, rszeno: purple)
0905231841<rszeno> hi
0905231914<stoopkid> hey rszeno
0905231924<stoopkid> passed out at my computer last night, sorry about that
0905231945<rszeno> np
0905232012*** Quit: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@236.152.broadband3.iol.cz) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
0905232632<rszeno> stoopkid, you know scala?
0905232741<stoopkid> nope, haven't checked it out at all
0905232831<rszeno> jmv need a scala developer
0905232911<stoopkid> what's he working on?
0905232944<rszeno> eulergui
0905233031<rszeno> he is the owner and developer
0905233200<rszeno> this irc channel belong to him,:)
0905233225<stoopkid> nice, that would be cool to work on, i guess i should learn scala and maybe down the road he'll be looking for somebody again
0905233326<rszeno> i doubt, he want people who care
0905233424<stoopkid> doubt he'll be looking for devs again?
0905233443<rszeno> yes
0905233620<rszeno> even now is not very enthusiast,:)
0905233713<stoopkid> hrm, i guess that doesn't make me very enthusiastic then either :)
0905233839<rszeno> maybe but you need to check what is doing first,:)
0905233904<rszeno> is intersting
0905233938<stoopkid> well i saw he popped in earlier, maybe he can go over it with me at some point
0905234017<rszeno> he poped for you, i told him
0905234047<stoopkid> woops, guess i should've stayed awake
0905234102<stoopkid> (not that i had much say in the matter heh)
0905234130<rszeno> np, you could explain him
0905234258<rszeno> or you can simple don't say nothing.
0905234701<rszeno> work is important not accidents
0905234825<rszeno> future work not previous,:)
0905234954<rszeno> experience is kind of irrelevant, is a new field
0905235018<stoopkid> true
0905235153<rszeno> you probably need to know n3, i can help you with this
0905235223<stoopkid> i'm pretty good with n3, koo and i built an euler reasoner replica
0905235245<rszeno> good
0905235321<stoopkid> there's a couple details with it that i'm unsure of that i'd like to go over with you two at some point, not at the moment though
0905235326<rszeno> jmv use n3
0905235346<rszeno> np
0905235422<rszeno> just ask when you need
0905235435<stoopkid> so, how much are these kinds of systems being used in industry?
0905235541<rszeno> jmv have some contracts in france
0905235619<rszeno> euler is sponsored by agfa
0905235738<rszeno> are not very used but are usefull, can be at least
0905235842<stoopkid> yea it's still beyond most people, afaict
0905235923<rszeno> actualy doesn't matter if data is rdf,turtle or n3
0905235958<rszeno> are only file formats
0906000028<rszeno> syntax
0906000058<rszeno> n3 have in plus rules
0906000219<rszeno> eulergui work with xml too
0906000316<rszeno> json-ld is closer to n3
0906000457<rszeno> i don't like json-ld,:)
0906000541<stoopkid> i haven't checked it out much yet
0906000605<rszeno> is good
0906000737<rszeno> i need a parse for it but was changed too often imo
0906000939<rszeno> i like stabile things even if are not so good
0906001023<rszeno> and things with less changes
0906001154<stoopkid> that's why i like logic programming and type-theory based languages, they've got fully designed logical frameworks based on natural logical principles, not much to be changed
0906001206<stoopkid> one of the reasons i like them*
0906001225<rszeno> is confusing to change something already deplayed somewher,:)
0906001335<rszeno> so, done something and use it only
0906001707<rszeno> probably i lose my patience
0906001803<stoopkid> well, understandably, why should the burden be on the user/customer to keep up with the changes
0906001819<rszeno> being old doesn't bring happyness,:)
0906001948<rszeno> probably i haven't too much patience when i was young too,:)
0906002143<rszeno> i remember i refused some clients just because they have contradictory requirements,:)
0906002154<stoopkid> i'm patient with people but i'm impatient when it comes to projects, i'm always anxious to keep things moving :)
0906002232<rszeno> i want  them done only
0906002329<stoopkid> you don't do it just for the love of coding? :)
0906002400<rszeno> no, coding is boring for me
0906002413<stoopkid> same, i've got no love/sentiment for it
0906002500<rszeno> is just coding, a necessary pain,:)
0906002616<rszeno> probably the reason i learn so much about computation was to avoid coding
0906002645<stoopkid> lol, yea makes sense
0906002745<rszeno> first reason for my friendship with jmv was generating code,:)
0906002849<rszeno> eulergui do some uniq things i never seen somewhere else
0906002934<rszeno> my only problem with him: is java,:)
0906003014<stoopkid> haha, understandable
0906003024<rszeno> probably i'm guilty for moving to scala



0906003059<rszeno> but doedn't make me too happy,:)
0906003105<stoopkid> i might as well learn java more in depth though considering all the money that gets thrown at it
0906003150<rszeno> yes, plus at this moment is the only posibility for mobile
0906003238<stoopkid> what do you mean?
0906003245<rszeno> is a huge market, bigger then was for pc
0906003335<stoopkid> i need to get some mobile devices
0906003336<rszeno> once you decide to do something for mobile java is the only option
0906003407<stoopkid> hrm, wasn't really aware of that
0906003453<stoopkid> i've played around with some ios dev on my friends' devices, not much but i don't remember having to use any java for it
0906003456<rszeno> is the only prog language accepted by mobile maker
0906003511<rszeno> simbian is dead
0906003555<rszeno> imo apple is another story
0906003559<stoopkid> i guess i need to look into this more
0906003616<rszeno> will end by being defeated
0906003821<rszeno> is hard to keep clients with hot stuff, will work a time but eat a lot of money and you are always in conflict with users wich use something else
0906003854<rszeno> so is just a matter of time
0906004046<rszeno> probably they repeat history, same happend with dos/windows but other hardware,:)
0906004253<rszeno> all the windows office was a replica of claris work
0906004426<rszeno> where is claris now? apple have siri probably a big avantage now but will not stay long
0906004617<rszeno> i don't have an iphone, is my fault, is too expensive here
0906004739<stoopkid> i don't have any mobile devices heh
0906004743<rszeno> as a software developer or designer i probably shoud have one
0906004839<stoopkid> same, i need to invest in some less mobile computing equipment first though
0906004847<rszeno> i have two smart phones and a lot of gadgets with bluetooth and wi-fi
0906004921<stoopkid> i have a flip-phone from like 2008 and some arduino stuff lol
0906004925<rszeno> one with android and one with simbian, a kind of
0906004958<rszeno> i hate android, is poor and buggy
0906005050<rszeno> plus my isp is a idiot full with problems
0906005313<rszeno> dns doesn't work on phone, custumer service are just some idiots who doesn't make any difference between a static and a dynamic ip
0906005418<rszeno> techincal stuff is good but you can't tell the about defectes, are isolated
0906005612<rszeno> so you simple can pass over the idiots from custumer service wich are decided to kill if is necessary to make you a happy customer,:)



0906005730<rszeno> over all doesn't help to much are polite but completly useless
0906005932<rszeno> some 'the' need to be 'them' in previus sentences,:)
0906010020<rszeno> like in "techincal stuff is good but you can't tell the about defectes, are isolated"
0906010039<rszeno> must be "techincal stuff is good but you can't tell them about defectes, are isolated"
0906010057<stoopkid> that's how i read it, didn't catch the typo
0906010156<rszeno> yes, we humans can do this, is a nightmair for a machine
0906010303<stoopkid> machines have no context
0906010307<rszeno> fixing typos and making clear entities
0906010317<rszeno> mine have
0906010333<stoopkid> heh, well you've got more sophisticated machines than i do
0906010337<stoopkid> well then*
0906010341<rszeno> the problem is disambiguation
0906010408<stoopkid> disambiguation is a matter of context
0906010522<rszeno> yes but not only, is also part of history, experience of listening and understanting
0906010559<stoopkid> that's most of what i mean by context
0906010627<rszeno> yes could be
0906010722<rszeno> i usualy use context to refere the local context
0906010804<rszeno> previous sentences in the disscution domain
0906010837<stoopkid> my terminology is totally informal here, i just mean the computer has to have some understanding of the world and the current situation in it in order to understand how to disambiguate
0906010901<stoopkid> i see things based on throwing as many statistical methods at the problem as possible... i don't think this the right track at all
0906011051<stoopkid> imo aside from pure sensory processing, it's a logical problem, and when it gets down to uncertainties, then we logically decide to use probabilistic reasoning, and that probabilistic reasoning is usually in a framework of logic that we engineer logically for the purpose of making the decision
0906011153<rszeno> fuzzy logic and multi-valued imo
0906011308<stoopkid> depends how fuzzy the domain of reasoning is, like when i see people throwing neural nets at a problem i'm like "ok but i don't foresee this thing learning math"
0906011344<rszeno> i use nn,:)
0906011516<stoopkid> don't get me wrong, nn's are great for what they're great for, i used a genetic algorithm to essentially automatically build a neural net for character recognition, and it worked amazingly well for the minimal amount of effort i put into it
0906011538<rszeno> actualy is a ugly hibrid of neural network, fuzzy logic, multi-value logic,:)
0906011554<stoopkid> but, the nn doesn't have any "understanding" of what's happening, it just kind of molds to a shape
0906011641<stoopkid> hybrid systems make sense to me
0906011718<stoopkid> actually hybrid systems are the only thing that make sense to me, if we were talking about general AI like a robot or something
0906011720<rszeno> none of them have any understanding, which is in author, who make it,:)
0906011823<rszeno> yes robots need nn else are just some toasters,:)
0906012040<rszeno> the mars man form linkedin told me some strange thing about conscience and psychology of robots
0906012203<stoopkid> my conclusion with people is that somehow our neural-net brains have the capacity for a universal and rigid logical framework like A -> (A -> B) -> B, but, now that we have this rigid & universal logical framework, we don't have to use a neural net to express it anymore, any type of computer could suffice and it's just a matter of how it interfaces with the
          <stoopkid> rest of the hybrid system where things are fuzzier
0906012228<stoopkid> i should probably say my hypothesis rather than my conclusion
          <rszeno> i would like to talk more with him, right now what he said doesn't make sense of me but who knows
0906012514<rszeno> Jeff Howard or Hawkins, the palm os inventor have a interesting  theory about brain and AI, you should read it
0906012549<rszeno> numeta is the company name
0906012644<stoopkid> reverse-engineering the neocortex eh?
0906012652<stoopkid> now they're on the right track
0906012721<rszeno> yes, is Hawkins
0906012822<rszeno> is a model but make sence
0906012840<stoopkid> i agree with everything i'm seeing on their site so far, i've had theories about the brain & AI that are along the same lines wrt the role of the neocortex
0906012945<rszeno> i avoided the brain in general
0906013001<stoopkid> it's a rabbit-hole
0906013035<stoopkid> thinking about thinking about thinking about...
0906013259<rszeno> yes plus the tempation to do as it is because it work,:)
0906013501<rszeno> actualy iften there is nothing logic in copying what you see in nature
0906013644<rszeno> to be 'inspired by' is good but require understanding or at least some similarity
0906013756<stoopkid> my general theory wrt the brain is that life basically started out with sensory input attached pretty much directly to a direct reaction, and over time these sensory units evolved into more sophisticated receivers attached to neural structures that had the capacity to sort of form a topological description of the sensory input they were receiving, and these
          <stoopkid> neural structures evolved into the CNS, the brain, where you see different components associated to the different sensory inputs and physical outputs in the cortex and cerebellum, and the central thalamus structure coordinating everything
0906013839<stoopkid> we get a topological structure of vision, a topological structure of sound, a topological structure of touch, taste, etc...
0906013849<stoopkid> then we get this frontal cortex
0906013910<stoopkid> a generalized topological reasoner, capable of reasoning over all of these
0906013928<stoopkid> and all of a sudden we're separated from the animals
0906014010<stoopkid> all of a sudden we can do math
0906014021<rszeno> yes same here, is about structure not values
0906014130<rszeno> peoples are not good with rigurous actions
0906014210<stoopkid> the neofrontal cortex is very young, evolutionarily, and it's what really gives us that capacity
0906014329<rszeno> yes, is like a map, every place on it is some history
0906014411<stoopkid> i don't base any of this off of any expertise in neurology or anything, i just know the basic structure of the brain and its components, when they evolved relative to each other, and the capabilities of different animals that have developed these components or not developed them
0906014502<rszeno> i don't know anything about brain,:)
0906014529<rszeno> well maybe some basic thing
0906014556<stoopkid> frontal cortex you get animals that can direct themselves according to logic. mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and such
0906014628<stoopkid> pre/neofrontal cortex you get humans that have fully abstractified logic
0906014642<stoopkid> math
0906014749<rszeno> Jeff point me to intentinality
0906014916<rszeno> is more important for me to detect how is working not how is done
0906014932<rszeno> i mean made
0906015209<rszeno> probably bulding machines like a brain will be possible but what is important is how the brain do what is doing, a model
0906015300<rszeno> similar with what was done with artifical neuron
0906015432<rszeno> all the rest are maybe important for medicine not IT

0906101853<editable-koo><stoopkid> a bit later down the road i've got a vague idea to combine git, editable-log and lemon into a system to keep track of everything done on a project
0906101856<editable-koo>tell me more
0906101924<editable-koo>im slowly starting to think of lemon as a serious data keeping solution
0906101940<editable-koo>once i add the new gui..
0906102008<editable-koo>ive started organizing my stuff around it
0906131212<stoopkid> hey
0906131239<stoopkid> gotta help a friend out with some stuff this morning but i'll go over the idea with you after we get done with that
0906132942<stoopkid> actually on second thought there's not much to go over, i don't have the idea worked out at all, i just have a vague idea that there could be a single point-of-access for everything related to a software project/team/business etc.. and that some combo of git, editable-log and lemon could be used for that
0906133133<stoopkid> like, we've got chat-logs, online references, documentation that we write, code, comments, etc..
0906133241<stoopkid> usually these things are just kind of scattered, and everybody participating just kind of remembers where to look for the different kinds of things they're looking for
0906133536<stoopkid> big & well-organized software dev companies like google and apple probably use some kind of sophisticated solutions to keep track of all their resources, but, i'm thinking of something much simpler, not an "enterprise solution" but an app that an individual or small team could use
0906133837<stoopkid> i don't see any reason why git couldn't be used for storing everything, so that's where git comes in, probably without needing to be changed at all
0906134629<kook_> its fine for storing
0906134642<kook_> not that fine for versioning triple kbs
0906134655<kook_> but..might not be that bad for a start
0906134721<kook_> a triplestore is the connecting idea
0906134732<kook_> maybe it can do its own versioning
0906134736<kook_> like the virtuoso thing
0906134808<kook_> what we store i imagine is gonna be some mix between "lemon" trees and more "basic" data
0906134828<kook_> hopefully virtuoso can store big files as well
0906134836<kook_> and that might be all
0906134904<kook_> then its a matter of migrating everything "into lemon"
0906134922<kook_> or into "more basic rdf"
0906135003<kook_> editable log....must die...and be recreated in lemon
0906135021<kook_> rszeno has irc-rdf gatewaying worked out i guess
0906135040<kook_> lemon will provide an editable projection/gui
0906135111<stoopkid> so you're thinking to have everything in a version-controlled triple-store?
0906135201<kook_> dunno if version-controlled triple-store or doing version-control as part of the data
0906135222<stoopkid> hrm, the latter seems like a good idea to me
0906135230<kook_> https://www.google.cz/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=rdf+version+control&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=FsrOV7_2EsKk8wecnK7wCA
0906135257<kook_> versioning on the rdf level is still low level
0906135313<kook_> just a bit above versioning on the serialization level
0906135448<kook_> shrug
0906135557<kook_> i imagine we'll want to keep our data as non-lemonish as possible, not a node representing a chat line, but a more widely adopted chat-line rdf class
0906135637<kook_> versioning can just mean saying "on friday, this document contained these lines:..."
0906135651<kook_> and thrown in the db

0907081554<jmv_> hi


0907081640<jmv_> Ruset was asking "what is now the biggest problem with eulergui?"
0907081722<jmv_> My answer : it does too much, and chould be modularized
0907081754<jmv_> And the idea of using internally the rule engine was a bad idea



0907085927<kook_> jmv_, do you know of any interesting jobs?
0907090853<jmv_> Test this Scala code : https://github.com/deductions/graph_proximity
0907114527<editable-koo>is that a job?:)
0907162116<jmv_> yes editable-koo , that just a beginning
0907162157<jmv_> editable-koo,  Do you have CV or a FOAF profile ?
0907162236<jmv_> jeanmarc.vanel@gmail.com
0907162300<jmv_> Or you can type your  FOAF profile here :

0907170957<jmv_> Would you like to tackle Scala languge ?
0907171419<editable-koo>bonjour
0907171433<editable-koo>ah, cool, i will try your semantic forms later
0907171545<editable-koo>its more stoopkid who is looking for a job now, i have a job right now
0907171602<editable-koo>but im looking for more interesting/better paying one
0907171723<editable-koo>i have enough free time on the side to try new things
0907171900<editable-koo>but right now im finishing my current task...
0907172139<editable-koo>so let me round that off first, or stoopkid, you wanna tackle this?
0907172318<editable-koo>right now i have a CV but in czech
0907172414<editable-koo>i would like to tackle scala, if we agree on some terms
0907172705<jmv_> OK, Scala is simply the best language if you're mathematically oriented,



0907174134<editable-koo>i type in C++, its offering cities

0907175056<jmv_> tHE DBpEDIA lookup service I'm calling has several other problems;
0907175139<jmv_> soon we will instead use embedded Lucene indexing

0907190753<editable-koo>but im still pissed white, not anymore because of money, or because i think my approach was better or comparable, just pissed at this code i have to write
0907190859<editable-koo>i guess i expected things to start boring me, expected not to be happy with the pay, expected getting depressed about days sitting at the office instead of spent outside

0908195223<discardedes> just a heads up
0908195242<discardedes> youre probably sitting on lemonparty under a certain username maybe?
0908195250<discardedes> maybe you can check it out
0908195251<discardedes> anyhoo
0908195255<discardedes> im off for now
0908195332<stoopkid> cya discardedes, we'll go over it more next time you're around
0908195345<discardedes> ok
0908195356<discardedes> ill have to take a next step, then well have something to talk about
0908195404<discardedes> maybe look into git as we talked about
0908195412<discardedes> actually seems like a great first step to doing this
0908195509<discardedes> so thats my plan, im going to study git again
0908195525<discardedes> and i want to get familiar with using the interface in a useful way
0908195538<discardedes> then we will have a bunch more to talk about
0908195559<stoopkid> yea should probably learn git, we'll surely be using it
0908195623<discardedes> ok... so thats the bottleneck to our next in depth discussion
0908195624<discardedes> :)
0908195730<discardedes> this is another thing about my workflow, i like to talk, plan, do, talk, plan, do...
0908195739<stoopkid> not a big bottleneck, you'd have no problem picking it up as we go along, but hey studying it in depth couldn't hurt, i should probably do the same myself
          <discardedes> we talked, i have a plan, now i have something to do, then we can talk
0908195741<discardedes> :)
0908195745<discardedes> i know

09/10 14:06:45<rszeno> hi.:)
09/10 14:07:10<rszeno> did you talk with jmv?
09/10 14:07:30<stoopkid> only a bit
09/10 14:08:09<rszeno> about job?
09/10 14:09:01<stoopkid> nah we didn't really get a chance to go over it yet
09/10 14:09:31<stoopkid> my hours and his don't seem to overlap much heh
09/10 14:10:33<rszeno> yes, europe hours and you hours are different,:)
09/10 14:12:25<rszeno> is a smell of missing desire on both sides,:)
09/10 14:15:09<stoopkid> well, i'm mostly focused on getting web-dev gigs started at this point, so i haven't really been making a full effort to dive into the scala thing yet
09/10 14:15:14<rszeno> jmv worked a long time in america
09/10 14:15:49<rszeno> he told me about semantic forms
09/10 14:17:32<rszeno> he use scala for web-dev
09/10 14:18:22<rszeno> actualy is indirect, scala for n3, n3 for web-dev
09/10 14:19:22<rszeno> eulergui in the processing support
09/10 14:21:07<stoopkid> ah, i meant "basic"/"typical" web-dev, like wordpress
09/10 14:21:45<rszeno> wordpress is just a mess
09/10 14:22:34<stoopkid> that's true but people are still paying for it
09/10 14:22:45<rszeno> it doesn't follow w3c drafts, actualy it doesn't follow anything
09/10 14:23:20<rszeno> who care, peoples are paying a lot of shit,:)
09/10 14:23:38<stoopkid> the only thing i care about right now is what people are paying for
09/10 14:23:42<rszeno> is not a reason, imo
09/10 14:24:31<rszeno> think to their needs not what they pay because is not relevant
09/10 14:25:22<stoopkid> me understanding their needs and me making them understand their needs are unfortunately two very different things
09/10 14:26:22<rszeno> you don't need to make them understand their needs,:)

09/10 14:29:03<rszeno> new needs means new requirements always, you can't invent new needs,:)
09/10 14:29:34<rszeno> they come by using what they get

09/10 14:32:35<rszeno> cms are a nightmair now and always in the past
09/10 14:33:01<editable-koo>im definitely lacking enthusiasm for diving into a new language and new ecosystem for a perfectly vague and muddy promise of collaboration with jvm:)
09/10 14:33:23<stoopkid> hrm, i agree that this is how it should be, but i've rarely employers to be that flexible, especially at the beginning & especially when they already think they have an idea for how they want to handle it
09/10 14:34:29<rszeno> editable-koo, both java and scala are not new,:)
09/10 14:34:44<editable-koo>for me
09/10 14:34:45<stoopkid> i think he meant new to me and him
09/10 14:35:09<rszeno> ok, :)
09/10 14:35:42<rszeno> i hate java and i don't love scala too,:)
09/10 14:36:21<rszeno> probably i should work with jmv,:)
09/10 14:36:24<editable-koo> im not fond of java either
              <stoopkid> i'm definitely interested, but, i'm also in a pretty tight spot financially and shouldn't devote too much time to anything that doesn't have a price-tag on it until i take care of my situation
09/10 14:37:18<rszeno> stoopkid, use google to search for vanel
09/10 14:38:20<stoopkid> crap, first time i've visited linkedin since i reinstalled my OS
09/10 14:38:22<rszeno> and reject url to the actress,:)
09/10 14:38:26<stoopkid> now it thinks i speak french
09/10 14:38:33<stoopkid> and unfortunately i don't XD
09/10 14:39:08<rszeno> what can i say, is google,:)
09/10 14:40:01<rszeno> actualy i understand french, doesn't bother me,:)
09/10 14:40:42<stoopkid> i had 10 years of french class during K-12, it apparently didn't work at all :)

09/10 14:42:18<rszeno> i have only few hours and was a beautifull teacher
09/10 14:42:43<editable-koo>:)
09/10 14:44:51<stoopkid> the curriculum was just totally incoherent, they'd basically repeat what they taught us in 1st grade every year, try a bit to move beyond that, and then the school year would end and we'd do it all over again
09/10 14:45:30<stoopkid> so i speak french at like a mentally challenged 1st grade level :)
09/10 14:46:24<rszeno> i don't speak, missing vocabulary
09/10 14:47:17<rszeno> but i can undestand, same with italian
09/10 14:48:01<rszeno> romanian are closer to both
09/10 14:49:31<editable-koo>like how i can understand a lot of russian and polish
09/10 14:49:40<rszeno> starting from 1800 in romania we had a lot of peoples who used french  words
09/10 14:50:04<rszeno> russian is hard for me

09/10 14:51:45<rszeno> i don't,:)
09/10 14:53:45<rszeno> i love to understand a lot of languages but...,:)

09/10 14:54:43<rszeno> also some lang from africa too
09/10 14:55:23<stoopkid> i used to spend a lot of time learning languages until the 1000th person asked me "but why? you already know english"
09/10 14:55:57<rszeno> is good to know,:)
09/10 14:57:00<rszeno> english is kind of universal but some parts are lost in translations
09/10 14:58:29<rszeno> in fact the culture is also lost,:)
09/10 14:59:20<rszeno> korean is a good example
09/10 15:02:49<rszeno> some thing look like a nonsense when are translated and are out of their historical context
09/10 15:03:40<rszeno> probably is same thing for many languages not only korean
09/10 15:04:09<editable-koo> the problem with english is the lack of variety of swear words
09/10 15:05:13<rszeno> is not only english,:)
09/10 15:05:39<rszeno> this is one i admire: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Ji-sub
09/10 15:06:00<rszeno> is very creative
09/10 15:16:37<rszeno> editable-koo, just swear in romanian, are planty of words,:)
09/10 15:17:42<rszeno> sometimes i bet even translation to english make you swear,:)

09/10 15:34:54<stoopkid> never used it, i just couldn't imagine using wordpress for a project sophisticated enough to be asking for AI of any sort

09/10 15:55:57<stoopkid> https://smartblogger.com/wordpress-hosting/
09/10 15:56:35<stoopkid> after reading this i have absolutely no clue why anybody would opt to host on wordpress.com rather than just setting up the free/opensource wordpress software themselves
09/10 16:00:21<stoopkid> "$3750/mo to use custom plugins" wtf
09/10 16:02:14<stoopkid> so you might be paying over $4000/mo to get all their "extra" features (which are just standard features in the actual wordpress software), and they can still shut down your account at their discretion without notice or justification

09/10 21:45:01<editable-koo>yo
09/10 21:45:35<editable-koo>so i contacted an old friend and he just finished a bechelor in marketing or management or somesuch and is looking for a job
09/10 21:46:08<editable-koo>ive been explaining a bit of newshit to him
09/10 21:47:14<stoopkid> nice, is he interested?
09/10 21:48:32<editable-koo>dunno yet
09/10 21:49:12<editable-koo>ill keep talking to him
09/10 21:49:23<editable-koo>he used to do flash animations btw
09/10 21:50:34<editable-koo>well my ex had been doing some flyer designs
09/10 21:50:53<editable-koo>and maybe other photoshop stuff here and there
09/10 21:51:48<editable-koo>probably not website design
09/10 21:52:16<editable-koo>we were reworking a flash banner once
09/10 21:52:26<editable-koo>ActionScript
09/10 21:52:29<editable-koo>never again
09/10 21:54:24<editable-koo>well the tau logo really looked like for a hotdog stand in the end
09/10 21:54:45<editable-koo>it was a bit of a design by comittee tho:)
09/10 21:55:34<editable-koo>but yea got ohad impressed enough for a while
09/10 21:57:54<stoopkid> well if you'd wanna try to bring either of them into this i'd be down to try and work with them and see how that goes; i'm not worried if they don't have software/web-dev experience since we've already got that reasonably well covered anyway and the main thing we could use at this point is soft-skills to help break us into the markets
09/10 21:59:50<editable-koo>https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/?q=wordpress
09/10 22:01:26<editable-koo>yea ill try to scout the terrain over next days
09/10 22:03:04<editable-koo>and maybe old hdds, theres got to be a webpage i put together with her "portfolio" kind of links
09/10 22:04:41<editable-koo>http://asset-2.soupcdn.com/asset/13935/9351_2a52_520.jpeg
09/10 22:04:43<editable-koo>not this
09/10 22:07:54<stoopkid> i've got a friend here who also recently got a bachelor's in marketing/management/something. i've been trying to get him involved with shit since tau-chain since i know he's got a head on his shoulders for that type of thing and that i can fully trust him when it comes to money, unfortunately though he'd never work on anything unless it was already paying
              <stoopkid> him
09/10 22:08:34<editable-koo>speaking of design, if anyone still has flash: http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/
09/10 22:09:00<editable-koo>smart guy
09/10 22:09:04<editable-koo>your friend
09/10 22:10:08<stoopkid> heh, he often says stuff like "man i wish i was smart like you with math and computers and stuff" and i'm like "man i wish i was smart like you with not going broke regularly"
09/10 22:10:45<stoopkid> "wanna trade?" "nah.."
09/10 22:23:24<stoopkid> oh actually i've told you about that guy before; that's the guy that i was living with him and his dad until i moved back in with my parents last year
09/10 22:23:40<stoopkid> and if i don't start making money by november i might be living him again
09/10 22:23:45<stoopkid> living with*
09/10 22:25:17<stoopkid> but, there's actually a shitload of non-software work i could do for them for income during the next year
09/10 22:29:47<stoopkid> just random shit that you usually can't find a dedicated person for like cleaning their kitchen or going up to his grandparents' house to scare the snakes out
09/10 22:34:43<stoopkid> hell, i'd get bit by a venomous snake right now just to be able to have a story from my recent life that isn't just what software i've been working on

09/14 21:04:00<editable-koo>hows it going?
09/14 21:07:22<editable-koo>stoopkid
09/14 21:07:31<stoopkid> yo
09/14 21:07:47<editable-koo>yo
09/14 21:07:53<stoopkid> it's goin alright, how bout you
09/14 21:08:12<editable-koo>yea too
09/14 21:08:59<editable-koo>the usual shit aside hehe
09/14 21:09:44<editable-koo>i was thinking i should try to take a look at the scala stuff
09/14 21:10:31<stoopkid> i'm gonna hold off on that til i'm more set up with other things
09/14 21:20:57<sirdancealot> computing graph proximity isnt my cuppa
09/14 21:22:27<sirdancealot> at least the lib it depends on has some test data
09/14 21:25:11<sirdancealot> in some undocumented format
09/14 21:25:27<stoopkid> wrt theoretical/advanced stuff i'm probably only really gonna work much on tau and maybe some lemon if you've got specific ideas for it
09/14 21:26:27<sirdancealot> lemon is full of specific ideas
09/14 21:27:34<sirdancealot> but working on it is like advancing on a WW1 battlefield
09/14 21:27:52<stoopkid> heh
09/14 21:29:18<sirdancealot> one specific idea is getting the precedence/associativity stuff done but i dont feel like diving into it myself
09/14 21:29:44<sirdancealot> i get by with the editor
09/14 21:31:05<sirdancealot> i guess untill you have a specific use for it yourself, i cant get you into it
09/14 21:31:28<sirdancealot> meanwhile, i have some kind of vision that ill be bashing towards
09/14 21:32:53<sirdancealot> probably mostly in the areas of desktop shell language and data management
09/14 21:33:25<sirdancealot> personal uses
09/14 21:35:13<sirdancealot> buuut...im thinking id really appreciate if you looked into jmv's stuff
09/14 21:35:27<sirdancealot> i can set it up and make it build and stuff
09/14 21:35:54<stoopkid> sure if you've got anything in particular you want me to look at i can check it out
09/14 21:35:55<sirdancealot> and you could make sense of the test data and come up with a few tests
09/14 21:36:47<sirdancealot> im pretty curious what other work jmv would have in store for us, it could be a great connection wrt all our other interests
09/14 21:37:38<stoopkid> wrt lemon i've got ideas for what i'd like out of such a system, just haven't gotten around to really working it out
09/14 21:38:56<stoopkid> and yea, i agree. it's just a lot to jump into while i've gotta figure out all this other crap so i just don't wanna dive into it at this point until i've got that stuff figured out
09/14 21:39:43<sirdancealot> yeah, for me its kinda cramming it too
09/14 21:40:20<sirdancealot> but lets see...
09/14 21:42:48<sirdancealot> was i right about phpmyadmin?
09/14 21:43:35<stoopkid> it's no mysql workbench but it's open source and i can get the job done just as effectively without the slight extra conveniences
09/14 21:44:44<stoopkid> plus as a web developer who recently learned wordpress which is centered around mysql & php, i should probably have it on my tool-belt :)
09/14 21:46:14<stoopkid> setting it up manually and playing with the configuration files was definitely educational as well, might be the most valuable thing i got out of it (not to discredit the other things)
09/14 21:46:24<sirdancealot> cool
09/14 21:47:14<stoopkid> still haven't got to remote access my server but that's because my web-host has everything split up weird and i'm trying to figure out how to set up remote access (if i can)
09/14 21:48:11<stoopkid> could set one up on your ec2 to test it out, but i need to figure out how to do this anyway heh
09/14 21:50:11<stoopkid> also been procrastinating on IDEs for all the languages i work with
09/14 21:50:28<stoopkid> i get by on vim but i feel i need to step up my game a bit
09/14 21:51:01<sirdancealot> depends how deep you go with vim
09/14 21:51:12<stoopkid> i don't :)
09/14 21:51:17<stoopkid> but maybe i could
09/14 21:51:37<sirdancealot> if you use all the modes and stuffs then id think it would be a fine route
09/14 21:51:55<stoopkid> i guess i need to make some time to check that out
09/14 21:51:57<stoopkid> ah
09/14 21:51:59<stoopkid> schedules
09/14 21:52:02<stoopkid> those things
09/14 21:52:05<stoopkid> i should make one
09/14 21:52:57<sirdancealot> as on phpmyadmin it doesnt seem to be in the repos of that weird aws distro, so i guess its download the tgz and ..stuff
09/14 21:54:55<sirdancealot> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/phpMyAdmin#Lighttpd
09/14 21:56:38<sirdancealot> my right hand has been hurting .. i wonder if its the shitty workplace setup , or just much clicking that i have to do there
09/14 21:56:50<sirdancealot> *too
09/14 21:57:12<sirdancealot> i should bring a second keyboard tomorrow
09/14 21:57:36<sirdancealot> and maybe take time off typing over the end of the week
09/14 21:57:42<stoopkid> that's how my hand got when i had to do the circuit diagrams on the plc
09/14 21:58:06<sirdancealot> i c
09/14 21:58:24<stoopkid> is my key in authorized_users?
09/14 21:59:23<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 21:59:35<sirdancealot> ec2-user
09/14 22:00:04<stoopkid> i'm getting permission denied (public key)
09/14 22:00:19<stoopkid> is this what's in there?
09/14 22:00:24<stoopkid> ssh-rsa
              <stoopkid> AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDM85VnibHKQTBNfqgNyNmT7nANAlBky5YAAqZuxIRmia6o9reE5Rv4s6j3V+bVPCt+aBWtYdOmJBH9+eM4T5CXFt6B2pZYXHZZpEhbtUD4YDiNEBMxjxh7vL6OQziuoye5z9MxUxf9r/PtmMzExkBqSiDWWdnTYPFy0CYFJVp1RlwX8M1A0diqf5l0S09aacxwdTEIN5kisnx82NBSKYlAEDRh086WMsEi36gpy5YovWVY3U/FfVHGxkif4mHVVIfuTVXvm1XKly/apUDZXtEdu7LzZSwVscPw0ipUbdsT1qwwPfJlYMLetmsfoop9OOKJaKud35/4
09/14 22:00:25<stoopkid> QHQjEpUAv4nf stoopkid@stoopkid-SVF15323CXW
09/14 22:00:30<sirdancealot> no
09/14 22:00:53<stoopkid> maybe i haven't been on there since i reinstalled my os
09/14 22:01:19<sirdancealot> ok now
09/14 22:01:49<stoopkid> still denied
09/14 22:03:22<sirdancealot> hmm
09/14 22:03:43<sirdancealot> whats your command line?
09/14 22:04:08<stoopkid> nvm i'm in
09/14 22:04:39<stoopkid> i had sudo in there out of habit and it must check a different spot for the ssh keys
09/14 22:05:10<sirdancealot> alright run a new tmux session or a screen session for the phpmyadmin stuff
09/14 22:05:29<sirdancealot> yea that would be /root i guess
09/14 22:26:35<stoopkid> as far as languages go, what i really want to set up is a dependent type theory system incorporating category theory
09/14 22:27:05<sirdancealot> works for me
09/14 22:32:50<sirdancealot> i got the custom node thing working
09/14 22:33:05<sirdancealot> so next time we're defining a language, it wont be from within python
09/14 22:33:44<stoopkid> nice
09/14 22:34:08<sirdancealot> if we first fix up the parser, we can work with everything stored as text, will be easier for collaboration over tmux
09/14 22:36:54<sirdancealot> if this hand pain keeps up im gonna shift my priorities to aural ui again
09/14 22:37:49<stoopkid> i'm still down for natural lang stuff for that, though my ideas are still mostly limited to type theory stuff
09/14 22:44:32<stoopkid> i wanna run something by you and see if it makes sense, it's pretty simple
09/14 22:44:47<sirdancealot> alright
09/14 22:45:08<sirdancealot> im tempted to say you should first define what making sense means but ok
09/14 22:46:54<stoopkid> let's say i've got a set, A, and proposition that asks whether objects in A satisfy some property
09/14 22:47:09<stoopkid> like, given an object from A, you're asking whether this property holds for that object
09/14 22:47:35<sirdancealot> ok
09/14 22:48:25<stoopkid> you could say that this proposition defines a subset of A, namely the subset where all the objects satisfy the property
09/14 22:48:58<stoopkid> and then there's other objects which don't satisfy the property, and aren't in the subset
09/14 22:49:15<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 22:49:43<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 22:50:40<stoopkid> alright, so, let's say you've got another set B, and a function f:B->A
09/14 22:51:01<stoopkid> do you see how a function maps the domain into a subset of the range?
09/14 22:51:16<stoopkid> i.e. f maps the objects in B into a subset of the objects in A?
09/14 22:51:58<stoopkid> (the subset might be the whole set but it's still a subset)
09/14 22:52:59<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 22:54:00<stoopkid> alright, so, we can pick out any subset of A using propositions that the objects must satisfy, and we can do the same using functions from B->A
09/14 22:54:18<stoopkid> and we can get all the subsets with either one
09/14 22:55:36<stoopkid> so, we might just say that propositions on A and functions from B->A are the same thing
09/14 22:56:23<sirdancealot> same thing for the purpose of ending up with sets of A
09/14 22:57:31<stoopkid> so, before going further, can you see how this corresponds to existential quantification over A?
09/14 22:58:34<stoopkid> "there exists a:A such that the property holds for a"
09/14 22:59:12<stoopkid> existential quantification over a set also defines a subset, and it's the same thing as the subset defined by the propositions and by the functions
09/14 22:59:29<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:00:34<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 23:02:27<stoopkid> alright, so not only does the function f:B->A correspond to a subset of A, it also corresponds to a *family* of subsets of B
09/14 23:02:45<stoopkid> specifically a partition of B
09/14 23:03:02<stoopkid> you know what a partition is in this context?
09/14 23:03:22<stoopkid> (in the context of subsets of a set)
09/14 23:03:40<sirdancealot> well you mean that the function can be used on different sets for input
09/14 23:03:58<sirdancealot> B
09/14 23:04:54<stoopkid> hrm, not quite. so a partition divides up a set into non-overlapping sets which cover the whole set
09/14 23:05:22<sirdancealot> two?
09/14 23:05:53<stoopkid> any number generally, you'll see where that number would come from in this case in a second
09/14 23:06:09<sirdancealot> i dont see how the preposition corresponds to stuff in B if we're talking about how it corresponds to stuff in A
09/14 23:07:10<stoopkid> alright, so let's say i pick an object a in A. it's got what's called a preimage, wrt the mapping f:B->A
09/14 23:07:12<sirdancealot> except in the sense that it divides subsets of B into those where all members have a corresponding A and where they dont
09/14 23:07:22<stoopkid> exactly
09/14 23:07:36<stoopkid> that's the partition of B
09/14 23:08:00<sirdancealot> ok so two partitions in this case
09/14 23:08:26<stoopkid> two partitions?
09/14 23:09:49<stoopkid> the number of subsets of B will be the same as the number of distinct elements of A that get mapped to
09/14 23:10:25<stoopkid> (one non-overlapping subset of B for the distinct element of A that this subset maps to)
09/14 23:11:49<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:12:16<sirdancealot> no, and frankly im out of wood at this point
09/14 23:12:32<sirdancealot> firewood
09/14 23:14:06<sirdancealot> two in the sense that you have elements of B that map to A and elements of B that dont
09/14 23:14:25<stoopkid> ah
09/14 23:15:10<stoopkid> well, actually every element of B will map to some element of A
09/14 23:15:23<stoopkid> the function acts on every element and returns an A
09/14 23:15:40<stoopkid> just not necessarily a distinct A, and not necessarily every A gets returned
09/14 23:16:19<stoopkid> so, in the set A there are two partitions, those that do get returned by f for some B, and those that don't
09/14 23:16:34<stoopkid> but *every* B gets assigned to *some* A
09/14 23:16:41<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:17:01<sirdancealot> ok
09/14 23:17:27<stoopkid> so, you do get a partition in B, but in a different way
09/14 23:17:55<sirdancealot> you get clusters of elements that map to the same value
09/14 23:18:06<stoopkid> exactly
09/14 23:18:19<stoopkid> so you can reverse that mapping and map values to clusters
09/14 23:18:41<stoopkid> that's called preimage, i.e. the preimage of an object in A is the cluster of elements that map to it
09/14 23:19:52<stoopkid> ok so, when we started out, B was just a set, but now because of this function f:B->A, it looks like a partition, with each cluster in the partition corresponding to some element of A
09/14 23:20:15<stoopkid> i.e., this set B is now "indexed" by this other set A, in a sense
09/14 23:20:55<stoopkid> now, consider the dependent sum, the existential quantifier in type theory
09/14 23:21:03<stoopkid> Sigma a:A . B(a)
09/14 23:21:26<stoopkid> what are the B(a)? they're the clusters in B
09/14 23:21:36<stoopkid> make sense?
09/14 23:23:57<sirdancealot> hmm
09/14 23:24:38<sirdancealot> not sure how to read this
09/14 23:25:01<stoopkid> anything in particular?
09/14 23:25:16<sirdancealot> the whole thing
09/14 23:25:35<sirdancealot> does this define a type of things?
09/14 23:26:54<stoopkid> hrm.. just stick to thinking of them as sets and functions for now and you'll see exactly how they end up corresponding to sigma types and pi-types
09/14 23:27:21<sirdancealot> whats the part after the dot?
09/14 23:27:46<stoopkid> after Sigma a:A . ?
09/14 23:28:11<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 23:28:32<stoopkid> ah woops, B(a) would be the cluster in B that maps to a
09/14 23:29:06<stoopkid> so, you know how the sigma type is a pair-type where the type of the second element can vary depending on the first element?
09/14 23:29:19<sirdancealot> yea
09/14 23:29:23<stoopkid> depending on the value* of the first element
09/14 23:29:30<stoopkid> that's what we essentially have here
09/14 23:29:55<sirdancealot> well
09/14 23:29:59<stoopkid> the clusters are the different "second-element types" corresponding to the different first element values
09/14 23:30:39<sirdancealot> but you left out the function
09/14 23:30:49<stoopkid> f:B->A?
09/14 23:31:11<sirdancealot> yea the f
09/14 23:32:18<stoopkid> for the sigma-type the f basically just defines what are the clusters in B and how they correspond to values in A (i.e. how the second-element type varies by the first-element value)
09/14 23:33:35<sirdancealot> if the f is not somehow a part of the "Sigma bla bla..." type declaration, then i have no way of actually instantiating that type
09/14 23:34:03<sirdancealot> or really no clue what you mean with it
09/14 23:36:38<stoopkid> alright, let's say you choose an arbitrary partition of B, i.e. any arbitrary way to cluster it's values, into N different clusters
09/14 23:37:14<stoopkid> and then you choose a collection of N distinct points in A
09/14 23:37:42<stoopkid> then you choose a way to pair clusters to points
09/14 23:38:47<sirdancealot> ok
09/14 23:39:31<stoopkid> so, given a point in A, paired to a cluster in B, you get some collection of pairs with an element in A and an element in the cluster of B
09/14 23:39:36<stoopkid> these are proofs of the sigma type
09/14 23:40:17<stoopkid> proofs that this point in A satisfies the property B
09/14 23:40:49<stoopkid> what do you need to prove Sigma a:A . B(a)? you need a pair where the first element is an object a:A and the second element is an object b:B(a)
09/14 23:43:05<stoopkid> so, wrt defining the sigma type here, imagine if you took the function f and drew an arrow from every point in B to the point it maps to in A
09/14 23:43:45<stoopkid> then these arrows (or their end-points i guess) are all the proofs of the sigma type
09/14 23:46:38<stoopkid> so, the sigma type is really all pairs (a,b) such that a is an element of A and b is an element of B(a)
09/14 23:47:20<stoopkid> which is just all the pairs of end-points in the arrows mapping inputs to outputs in the function f
09/14 23:47:47<stoopkid> does this make sense?
09/14 23:48:36<sirdancealot> i think i can follow
09/14 23:49:42<stoopkid> alright so, now let's say i have this same clustering in B, so for every a:A i have the same B(a)
09/14 23:49:57<stoopkid> (same as before, not same as each other)
09/14 23:50:31<stoopkid> now let's say i make a function going the other direction, g: A -> B
09/14 23:51:19<stoopkid> and let's say we add the constraints that g must map every object a:A to an element in B(a)
09/14 23:51:53<stoopkid> now we've got a dependent function, a pi-type, instead of a sigma-type
09/14 23:52:32<stoopkid> see how g is a function where the range type varies depending on the input value?
09/14 23:56:56<stoopkid> (i promise it's nearly over btw)
09/14 23:59:26<sirdancealot> mkay
09/15 00:02:35<stoopkid> if you understand everything up to this point then you understand how to express existential and universal quantification (dependent sums and products) using fairly basic properties of the behavior of functions
09/15 00:03:14<stoopkid> just to recap: every function f:B->A defines an existential quantification i.e. sigma type over it's domain , i.e. Sigma a:A . B(a)
09/15 00:03:57<sirdancealot> its every function now?
09/15 00:04:07<stoopkid> always was
09/15 00:05:11<stoopkid> every function has those properties of defining of subset of it's codomain and partitioning it's domain, right?
09/15 00:05:42<sirdancealot> yea ok
09/15 00:08:25<stoopkid> alright, so if you have a partition of B and associate each cluster in B to some distinct point in A, then if you have a function g: A -> B such that every point a:A maps to an object in B(a), i.e. the cluster in B associated to a, then this function g is essentially a dependent function right?
09/15 00:08:42<stoopkid> Pi a:A . B(a)
09/15 00:09:39<stoopkid> this function g is actually a proof of the type Pi a:A . B(a)
09/15 00:10:20<stoopkid> so, g applies to all elements in A, so it's like saying "for every a:A, the property B(a) holds"
09/15 00:10:57<stoopkid> alright, sanity check before we go any furhter
09/15 00:11:46<stoopkid> i'm claiming we have a way to express "there exists" and "for all" here, and it seems like it should work but let's make sure it passes some basic tests
09/15 00:12:37<stoopkid> so if i say "there exists a:A such that B(a)", this is defining a subset of A, where all the members of this subset have the property B

if you're confused about any of this just ask and i'll draw pictures

09/15 00:13:16<stoopkid> if any objects in A aren't members of this subset, then there exists a:A such that *NOT* B(a)
09/15 00:13:42<stoopkid> which means that the statement "for all a:A, B(a)" couldn't possibly be true
09/15 00:14:22<stoopkid> this means that we shouldn't be able to construct a function g: A -> B such that we can assign each object a:A to an object b:B(a)
09/15 00:14:55<sirdancealot> sorry gotta sleep now, we can try to continue tomorrow

09/15 20:51:53<stoopkid> i guess i should start making lists of what features i'm even looking for
09/15 21:00:46<stoopkid> as far as just text-editing and code-highlighting goes, i don't really need anything beyond what vim offers
09/15 21:01:20<stoopkid> would be nice if whatever i was using was integrated with git and FTP though
09/15 21:01:41<stoopkid> but, that's not a big deal, i can use other tools for all that
09/15 21:02:24<stoopkid> what vim really lacks is searching code, being able to click a name and find it's definition, all that stuff
09/15 21:02:49<stoopkid> and i'm not enough of a command-line pro to make up for it
09/15 21:03:04<stoopkid> (though maybe that's something i should fix)
09/15 21:19:25<stoopkid> yea everything i'm reading mostly suggests to me to just become awesome with vim..
09/15 22:42:49<stoopkid> what would be nice, along the lines of the lemon shell, is a tool that can interpret code or commands for you anywhere
09/15 22:43:10<stoopkid> for example, i want to install some software
09/15 22:43:25<stoopkid> there's a command line for it: " curl http://beyondgrep.com/ack-2.14-single-file > ~/bin/ack && chmod 0755 !#:3 "
09/15 22:43:51<stoopkid> i don't know off-hand what "!#:3" means, nor do i have a great idea of how to even go about finding
09/15 22:43:55<stoopkid> finding it*
09/15 22:44:34<stoopkid> somebody who knows linux a lot better than i do would probably be like "oh that's... " and then i'd say "okay", and that would be the end of that
09/15 22:44:45<stoopkid> until i run into the same situation again
09/15 22:45:11<stoopkid> would be nice if the computer could just tell me
09/15 22:45:53<stoopkid> assuming the line is a valid command line, then (by definition) it has all the tools it needs to actually interpret it and even execute it
09/15 22:46:56<stoopkid> and yet it doesn't know how to tell me this without actually running the command, who's ultimate effect isn't something i can determine yet

09/16 01:21:15<editable-koo>iirc i was calling this idea "lesh" at one point
09/16 03:42:15<stoopkid> which idea?
09/16 03:50:26<sirdancealot> describing an ordinary shell language in lemon, ..
09/16 03:52:25<stoopkid> ah, yea should've been able to tell that
09/16 03:53:59<sirdancealot> yesterday i created my first qt gui app
09/16 03:54:39<sirdancealot> with tableView with some stuff
09/16 03:54:42<sirdancealot> kinda cool
09/16 03:55:16<sirdancealot> i could start applying this to building the new lemon gui right away
09/16 03:55:55<stoopkid> nice, i guess i should start learning it then
09/16 03:56:12<sirdancealot> sorry about your math stuff...its just almost excruciating to read and follow what you say
09/16 03:56:26<stoopkid> lol no worries
09/16 03:56:29<sirdancealot> shrug..you cant study everything at once
09/16 03:58:07<stoopkid> i'm rethinking and simplifying a lot of it anyway
09/16 03:59:27<stoopkid> speaking of which, i decided i should start a math blog
09/16 03:59:43<sirdancealot> i was thinking i should start a software hate blog
09/16 04:00:00<stoopkid> i read and write about it all the time, just not on a permanent place that might get views from people searching the internet
09/16 04:00:08<stoopkid> heh
09/16 04:14:19<stoopkid> alright i've got a better way to explain the math thing, it'll be 100x shorter and i don't think it'll be excruciating, just want to see if the concept is accessible, i'll pastebin it
09/16 04:17:31<sirdancealot> ok
09/16 05:02:01<stoopkid> http://pastebin.com/fkJT1D7G
09/16 08:37:04<stoopkid> i'm a fan of the idea of editors that prevent you from making erroneous code
09/16 08:38:03<stoopkid> just needs to be coupled with the ability to make incomplete code & code with errors, as long as it's separated
09/16 08:43:12<stoopkid> or, better, instead of not giving you the option to change the code into an error state, it gives you the option to restrict yourself to moves that don't put it into an error state, if that's what you want to do
09/16 09:12:03<sirdancealot> sure
09/16 10:31:54<stoopkid> so, as a lang for defining langs, i think this would make a good basis for a tool for reverse-engineering software
09/16 10:32:11<stoopkid> which is something i'm definitely interested in, cause i have to do it the hard way all the time
09/16 10:35:38<stoopkid> essentially layered decompilation
09/16 10:38:13<stoopkid> you get some binary file, you don't know what it is, so you disassemble the binary, into a description of an executable containing assembly and data, and then you further decompile parts of this executable, etc.. storing a layered model that has the description at each layer
09/16 10:40:19<stoopkid> you'd want a lang for expressing langs for this because you'd need to be able to extend it with definitions of existing languages so it can decompile according to them and also definitions of languages you create yourself, for custom reverse engineering
09/16 10:41:28<stoopkid> for example, let's say that gcc has a bug, and it's not compiling right
09/16 10:41:52<stoopkid> then obviously for the decompilation you can't use the existing c language definition
09/16 10:42:11<stoopkid> there might not be any language definition you can use beyond the disassembly
09/16 10:42:25<stoopkid> that's where the need for custom languages comes in
09/16 10:42:30<stoopkid> (at least one place)
09/16 10:43:43<stoopkid> beyond this, you can think of applying it not just to an executable binary file, but any binary file at all, like all the memory on your computer
09/16 10:44:37<stoopkid> for example, you've got the bootloader section of your computer, it's got a particular file format, you might want to use/define a language to decompile it into a representation that you can work with
09/16 10:45:45<stoopkid> if lemon shell is something that's actually acting as a shell, then you can use this as the interface to control your computer from
09/16 10:48:07<stoopkid> i guess you could describe it as a shell where languages and the things you do with them are first-class constructs
09/16 10:49:09<stoopkid> idk, maybe i should ponder some unix philosophy here
09/16 10:50:34<stoopkid> we have various things we want to incorporate into this and it's already fairly monolithic as it is, is there a logical way we can break it up into interoperable but self-contained components that together get the whole job done?
09/16 11:00:54<stoopkid> here's essentially how i imagine this. on unix everything is a file. on lemon, every file has a language (or set or hierarchy(s) of them)
09/16 11:02:01<stoopkid> you have a system which essentially holds all your language definitions and different mappings between them
09/16 11:02:50<stoopkid> so it holds all your language definitions and all your compilers and decompilers
09/16 11:03:25<stoopkid> and gives you a feature-set that let's you easily use these "anywhere"
09/16 11:05:16<stoopkid> your languages are different syntaxes, and the mappings between them essentially give them semantics in terms of each other, but there's a particular semantics that we'd be concerned with here, and that's the semantics of a syntax in terms of rules defined in a formal, machine-interpretable logic
09/16 11:05:23<stoopkid> like, MLTT for example
09/16 11:06:49<stoopkid> this particular semantics is where go beyond saying "this c++ maps into this assembly" and say something like "this is what this assembly *does*, mathematically speaking"
09/16 11:08:37<stoopkid> so, then i see "shell" stuff as a separate component
09/16 11:09:24<stoopkid> the stuff before was purely about language definitions, and it's self-contained so why push it
09/16 11:11:18<stoopkid> yea, one could imagine using what i've laid out so far on another operating system or shell, so best to just leave that as-is, it's purely about languages
09/16 11:13:16<sirdancealot> yea the shell should be a library
09/16 11:14:16<stoopkid> i'm basically imagining it as a system that opens up all the details of your computer to description & interface through the language-definitions system
09/16 11:14:42<sirdancealot> well, youre imagining a pie in the sky
09/16 11:15:52<stoopkid> hrm, i don't think so
09/16 11:16:49<sirdancealot> ah, opens up , yea then
09/16 11:17:42<stoopkid> hrm? what did you think i was saying?
09/16 11:18:50<sirdancealot> that youre imagining the finished thing, with all the details of your computer covered
09/16 11:20:44<stoopkid> ah, yea no. a system that would have basic things covered like basic disassembly maybe, for some select few popular systems, but would then let you use the language-definitions system to extend this and get a better picture of your system the more language-definition you put into it
09/16 11:22:33<stoopkid> like, essentially you'd have a relatively simple system that just let's you store language definitions and various parsers, compilers, decompilers, etc.. for them in an organized place that makes it easy to use any of them at whim
09/16 11:23:48<sirdancealot> yea well thats just a subthing of the system that lets you store and organize all other stuff
09/16 11:27:45<stoopkid> that's possible, i hadn't thought of that
09/16 11:28:23<stoopkid> this language-definitions thing is pretty self-contained though, definitely something that hypothetically should be able to work by itself
09/16 11:30:35<sirdancealot> well yea
09/16 11:30:49<sirdancealot> we didnt run mltt thru the shell, did we?
09/16 11:31:15<stoopkid> didn't we?
09/16 11:31:57<stoopkid> or do you mean the lemon shell
09/16 11:32:11<sirdancealot> lemon shell
09/16 11:32:20<stoopkid> no i don't think we did
09/16 11:39:19<stoopkid> so, i think we'd want to be able to use the logical framework where we're interpreting our languages to also impose constraints on the state of the system through the shell
09/16 11:40:02<stoopkid> for example, you might want to impose some constraints on your bootloader section of memory
09/16 11:40:31<sirdancealot> what logical framework?
09/16 11:41:28<stoopkid> like MLTT
09/16 11:43:06<stoopkid> with languages, if you want the computer to "understand" them, i.e. be able to reason about them, then you have to express their semantics in terms of some system of machine-interpretable formal logic, like MLTT for instance
09/16 11:43:52<stoopkid> and if you want to impose constraints on your computer, you also need a system of machine-interpretable formal logic to express those
09/16 11:44:56<stoopkid> just like you need a type-system to express constraints on your programs
09/16 11:46:29<stoopkid> so, like with the languages, this isn't "everything's gonna be expressed in logic", it would be "anything can be related into logic"
09/16 11:47:19<stoopkid> so, you can progressively give the system more vocabulary with the languages and more understanding with the logic
09/16 11:48:48<stoopkid> the rest of the shell would just be like.. a shell, or, whatever other additions we have for that
09/16 11:51:07<stoopkid> this is just my addition to it :)
09/16 11:51:52<sirdancealot> sounds good
09/16 12:01:54<stoopkid> so, we talked a bit before about how one of the big difficulties in CNL (and one of the big reasons actual NLP is still out of the question) is that the language is highly dependent on the concepts, so it actually needs to have some kind of "understanding" of the concepts (and the current situation, and sometimes even the history leading up to it) in order
09/16 12:01:55<stoopkid> to figure out what to do based on what you're saying
09/16 12:05:40<stoopkid> so, all these concepts need to be made machine-interpretable and collected into a database that it can use for processing
09/16 12:07:32<stoopkid> now, you brought up earlier the system for organizing everything
09/16 12:08:55<stoopkid> well, there's a database of lots of information, then it's mainly a matter of translating between database of information <--> logic <--> language
09/16 12:15:28<stoopkid> for actual NLP, which we'd need for the voice-controlled-computer, this is how i'd go about that:
09/16 12:16:48<stoopkid> you can use the language-definitions system to define languages, like a CNL
09/16 12:17:32<stoopkid> the CNL can be made to work with the logic framework, to interface between the language and a database of logical concepts, so that it can actually have an understanding of your CNL
09/16 12:19:41<stoopkid> for NLP, this is basically how i think of it, first, the computer attempts to interpret it through CNL
09/16 12:20:34<stoopkid> this inevitably fails in most cases, but different parts of the sentence will usually match some part of the CNL, so it's got something to work with
09/16 12:21:38<stoopkid> the rest of the parts that aren't interpretable by the CNL then get examined further
09/16 12:22:22<stoopkid> here you can employ any arbitrary method to try to guess how it should be interpreted
09/16 12:23:30<stoopkid> like for example taking some neural net and running it on the text and seeing what's the closest known CNL text it might be, or checks a bunch of things it might be to see if they fit with the sentence
09/16 12:24:13<stoopkid> now, the trick is, you can use any arbitrary method to try to determine a meaning, but you only accept that meaning if it "makes sense"
09/16 12:25:29<stoopkid> and you might say that "making sense" is that the sentence corresponds to some well-formed concept in the logic, which isn't the False concept
09/16 12:28:54<stoopkid> so, i would use neural nets here because they can be progressively trained on the NLP data
09/16 12:29:33<stoopkid> think of it like this, you use the same concept for interpreting voice to words
09/16 12:32:00<stoopkid> you can use any arbitrary method (usually neural nets or some other AI) to try to guess what the word is, but you only accept it if the sounds actually correspond to a word and not just random noises
09/16 12:33:20<stoopkid> then what we do is build legs for this thing and tell it to get us a beer :)
09/16 12:40:00<stoopkid> so, you'd have a situational awareness component, which is dependent on the logic and the database of concepts
09/16 12:40:12<stoopkid> this is necessary for the voice-to-code
09/16 12:40:27<stoopkid> or, i should say more generally, voice-controlled-computer
09/16 12:41:09<stoopkid> i.e. there would be concepts in the database representing the current situation, and logic to reason about it
09/16 12:44:08<stoopkid> i think it's also necessary for general non-voice CNL as well, if it's to work for documents of any length / complexity
09/16 12:47:54<stoopkid> i.e. it needs to understand how there are different situations at different parts of the document, and how to reason about this
09/16 12:51:20<stoopkid> this is pretty complex, but that's the system you want right? extensible CNL-aware voice-controlled computer
09/16 12:52:49<stoopkid> also, what we build at first doesn't have to look anywhere near this complex
09/16 12:53:15<stoopkid> it's just packaging for what will eventually go into it
09/16 13:03:10<sirdancealot> sure
09/16 13:08:04<stoopkid> setting up the logic and allowing it to work with a database is easy; we've already built an MLTT. making this language-definitions system isn't too hard either, especially since you've already got a lot done toward it with lemon. to relate a language to logic, we express that language in the logic and then relate it to other concepts there
09/16 13:08:20<stoopkid> that goes for CNL too. that would just be the easiest way to do it, afaict
09/16 13:10:17<sirdancealot> i need to fix up mostly the parser and the menu
09/16 13:13:18<sirdancealot> still havent finished the "make this useful to myself" stage
09/16 13:15:29<sirdancealot> once im done with that and i have more shell-type functionality, (and czech internationalization of the most important stuff) im seriously thinking ill contact the guy i once worked with, ask if he'd want to invest in this
09/16 13:15:42<stoopkid> that'd be cool
09/16 13:18:08<stoopkid> somebody showed me how to define languages in agda, so once we have the language definition stuff worked out in lemon we could automatically map the syntax of languages into the logic so that you can immediately get started with relating the vocabulary to other concepts
09/16 13:20:50<stoopkid> i guess everything can hypothetically be framed within the logic, it just might only have very simple logic applied to it at first
09/16 13:23:21<stoopkid> but then again, it shouldn't be monolithic, so having the language-definition system separate from the logic makes sense to me, though we can still provide the automatic mapping of the language syntax into the logic (whenever possible; i don't think there would be much limitation here) so that you can get started defining the semantics right away
09/16 13:26:42<sirdancealot> http://www.mobility.siemens.com/mobility/global/de/nahverkehr/strassenverkehr/Documents/webfeature-smart-mobility-solutions/index.en.html
09/16 13:28:35<stoopkid> i never knew how much siemens had to do with my traffic experience
09/16 13:29:32<sirdancealot> yea youd barely find your toilet without them
09/16 13:30:07<sirdancealot> srsly tho im pondering sending them my cv
09/16 13:30:14<stoopkid> they're doing a terrible job with the traffic in baltimore heh
09/16 13:30:20<sirdancealot> hehe
09/16 13:30:33<stoopkid> you should, they'd probably pay well if they hired you
09/16 13:31:45<stoopkid> i'm pretty sure they're multinational so i don't think you'd have a problem there, and the elektroline work demonstrates that you can work on exactly this kind of stuff
09/16 13:34:33<stoopkid> wrt this system i'm describing, just to be clear, when i say that the semantics would be defined in the logic, that doesn't mean that this would be the only place that you can define semantics, but the rest would be just whatever you want to do with the language-definition system, cause that includes your compilers, parsers, syntax-highlighting, etc..
09/16 13:36:16<stoopkid> but, when it comes to having something like voice-controlled-computer or something that can logically integrate the information on your computer, you need to single out a system of *logic* in order to do it
09/16 13:37:23<stoopkid> you might say that you can use different systems of logic for different things
09/16 13:38:07<stoopkid> and you can, but then those things can't be logically related anymore, so it's kind of deficient to have any more than one logic for the purposes of a thing doing reasoning
09/16 13:39:32<stoopkid> so, whatever logic you pick, you want to try to express as many concepts and relations as possible in that logic, without resorting to using another logic, or else you lose the benefit of having logical relations between things in the first place
09/16 13:41:08<stoopkid> so especially for something like a "generalized" voice-controlled-computer that needs to relate vocabulary to all the concepts on the computer, you need to have a single logical framework in order to relate everything together
09/16 13:43:29<stoopkid> MLTT is machine-interpretable logic and adequately models basic human reasoning, with arbitrary computational capacity, i think it's a suitable logical framework for <insert anything you think you need logic for>
09/16 13:44:23<stoopkid> so, not to restrict what logic anybody wants to use for their semantics, but that's the one i'd choose for relating things together in my system
09/16 13:48:56<stoopkid> so, i think instead of having the logic and database be separate components, i think the logic should *be* a database
09/16 13:49:21<stoopkid> like, imagine if agda was a database rather than a "programming language"
09/16 13:50:54<stoopkid> so, we wouldn't force the full complexity of that on the user, we'd model a simpler kind of database within this agdabase system and let users play in that until they want to delve into the full complexity
09/16 13:51:46<sirdancealot> yea basically tau
09/16 13:52:23<stoopkid> mmm, maybe if we incorporated DHT and a nomic block-chain into it?
09/16 13:52:45<sirdancealot> shrug
09/16 13:53:13<stoopkid> it's the part of tau that i know how to build anyway :)
09/16 13:53:45<stoopkid> s/anyway/though/
09/16 13:53:58<sirdancealot> not the part that makes magic happen imho
09/16 13:55:20<stoopkid> depends what magic you're talking about
09/16 13:55:31<sirdancealot> yeah
09/16 13:55:47<stoopkid> you don't need tau to make all the logical magic happen
09/16 13:55:57<stoopkid> that's just MLTT
09/16 13:56:52<sirdancealot> i was thinking also of the rdf part
09/16 13:56:57<stoopkid> oh
09/16 13:57:46<stoopkid> yea it would be exactly like tau in that regard, a database of MLTT, possibly expressed as rdf like in tau, possibly not
09/16 13:57:57<stoopkid> i could go either way
09/16 13:58:50<stoopkid> rdf/n3 has it's upsides and it's downsides; i'm still undecided how i feel about it
09/16 14:00:21<stoopkid> i do think that triple/quad logic is maybe the way to go, especially because it corresponds nicely to a foundation for categories, but idk how i feel about the rdf/n3 languages for this in particular
09/16 14:00:53<stoopkid> maybe some kind of "purified" version of these
09/16 14:04:14<stoopkid> but yea, so you've got a system like tau's knowledge-base to store your knowledge-base of information on your computer, and use the logical part of it to relate the concepts together and to the vocabulary of your languages
09/16 14:06:24<stoopkid> you can then use this to impose constraints on your computer, make complex queries against it, and you've got a foundation that i think would be suitable for CNL, especially after the small experiments we've done trying to map CNL expressions into type theory where we saw natural correspondences between human CNL concepts and type theory concepts
09/16 14:07:27<stoopkid> "and", "or", "if blank then blank", "every blank blanks", "there is a blank such that blank"
09/16 14:08:54<stoopkid> then it's setting up a voice interface to that CNL and you've got a voice-controlled-computer, to whatever extent we've built up the logic and language-definitions
09/16 14:14:39<stoopkid> now, i could build a real simplified version of this with/into lemon
09/16 14:18:03<stoopkid> i see how to put together a rough draft of the "basic packaging", which would demonstrate how the different components are supposed to fit together and implement a real real primitive version of what the system could be if the rough draft were completed into a full version of the basic packaging, and this was then extended like it's meant to be
09/16 14:19:22<stoopkid> so here's how it would go, in my imagination:
09/16 14:19:47<stoopkid> we take lemon how it is now, it let's us define languages and then semantics for them right
09/16 14:21:49<stoopkid> so, we make a little database where you can stick all the languages you define, like our lambda languages, and with them we store different kinds of "standard" semantics related to them, like the parsers/interpreters we made for them
09/16 14:23:09<stoopkid> right now in lemon you've got the lemon parser parsing everything, i would modularize this, so that you can get these things from any source, as long as you can run them through the packaging
09/16 14:24:21<stoopkid> i.e. if you've got some parser, and you can store it in the database such that it can be used with some standard command like "parse", then you should be able to use that
09/16 14:25:26<stoopkid> so, i'd have the lemon language-definition-language separate from the database-of-languages-and-their-supporting-tools
09/16 14:25:58<stoopkid> the former is a tool to let us easily generate things we can put in the latter
09/16 14:27:10<stoopkid> i'd take the MLTT we built, finish it, and then split it up to be a database, like in tau
09/16 14:27:38<stoopkid> maybe using the rdf, maybe not, but definitely taking all the compiler ideas in either case
09/16 14:29:28<stoopkid> i'd use a standard procedure of expressing languages in MLTT to automatically map the CFG syntaxes you generate in lemon into an MLTT representation of the language, stored in the MLTT-base
09/16 14:29:48<stoopkid> from there you can do w/e you want with it to relate it to other concepts in the MLTT-base
09/16 14:30:36<stoopkid> then, i'd look at the expressions of MLTT, and come up with a basic CNL for it, like we already experimented with
09/16 14:31:05<stoopkid> idk if CFG would be able to express that CNL
09/16 14:31:48<stoopkid> if not, no matter, we can build whatever kind of parser we need into it if CFG isn't sufficient
09/16 14:34:11<stoopkid> after that i'm not sure what steps to take. this is the basic setup, but then to finish it off you'd need the voice-to-CNL and the simplified subset of the MLTT-base
09/16 14:35:39<stoopkid> really you only need the voice-to-CNL, and the simplified subset could be done later, since this is only a proof-of-concept
09/16 14:36:57<stoopkid> i don't necessarily know how to go about the voice-to-CNL though, that's something i'd have to do a lot of research towards
09/16 14:37:15<stoopkid> maybe if you covered that then that would complete the chain here
09/16 14:38:30<stoopkid> once we have that voice<->language<->logic<->knowledge, we've got a voice-controlled reasoner
09/16 14:38:55<stoopkid> then it's just a matter of opening up your computer's functionality to it through the shell, and you've got voice-controlled-computer
09/16 14:39:34<stoopkid> how exactly to go about opening it up... that's something we'd need to think about, but i think just the voice-controlled reasoner is a decent enough thing to start with
09/16 14:40:01<stoopkid> if we don't have the voice-controlled-reasoner we can't have a voice-controlled-computer
09/16 14:40:14<stoopkid> i just can't see how it can work otherwise
09/16 14:41:48<stoopkid> well, i should specify, "work" in any kind of capacity that we've discussed wanting it to work in
09/16 14:42:23<sirdancealot> for voice recognition id start with plugging in gf
09/16 14:42:35<sirdancealot> shrug, i dont need mltt to voice-control my computer, but whaetever
09/16 14:43:48<stoopkid> not mltt necessarily, but if you want your voice-control to include a capacity for reasoning then you have a system of reasoning, i.e. some system of logic
09/16 14:44:51<stoopkid> whatever you end up doing to handle the voice-control is implicitly defining some kind of system of reasoning about the things you're saying
09/16 14:45:19<sirdancealot> nope its implicitly the big bang
09/16 14:45:54* stoopkid shrugs
09/16 14:47:19<stoopkid> it's reasoning whether it's a dispatch table of simple voice commands or a full-fledged mathematical prover reasoning over complex sentences and situations
09/16 14:48:22<stoopkid> neither is any more valid than the other, you should be able to make both or w/e you want and store these languages and the semantics into the language-definitions-and-tools-database
09/16 14:49:37<stoopkid> that being said, the only system of reasoning i'm gonna be designing any CNL for is gonna be MLTT or some framework with similar semantics and the same capabilities
09/16 14:52:06<sirdancealot> alright
09/16 14:53:45<sirdancealot> so is there a way thru this to make it worth for you to participate?
09/16 14:53:58<stoopkid> after i build a CNL system based on MLTT i might try other kinds of ways to handle the CNL, but i'd definitely start with the one based on MLTT, if only because that's the only way i actually have any idea how to build one capable of decent CNL processing
09/16 14:54:22<stoopkid> to participate in what?
09/16 14:54:46<stoopkid> you mean is there a way to profit off of these ideas?
              <sirdancealot> in developing any aspect of lemon
09/16 14:54:56<sirdancealot> no
09/16 14:58:09<stoopkid> are you asking if building lemon into this stuff would make it worth it for me to participate in building lemon?
09/16 14:59:08<stoopkid> if so then yea definitely, that's why i'm detailing how i'd go about adding the pieces i have in mind :P
09/16 15:01:27<stoopkid> i think it's only worth it for anybody though if i only worked on the parts that i have a clear picture of; for example i don't have a clear picture of how to make a good language-definition language, or an editor for it, or editors for the languages you make with it, or how to handle voice-to-CNL, or set it up with a shell that actually interfaces to the
              <stoopkid> computer
09/16 15:02:23<stoopkid> and i haven't dedicated much thought to these, relative to what i have along the lines of logic databases, CNL and reverse-engineering
09/16 15:05:16<stoopkid> luckily though, you've been focusing on all those parts that i haven't
09/16 15:08:07<stoopkid> put together, we've got the whole thing covered, especially since i'll pick up on that stuff once i'm working in that context and seeing what's going on and how it should fit together with the logic-database, language-database & CNL
09/16 15:10:28<stoopkid> i don't think it would take us long at all to set up the logic-database and integrate it with the languages defined in lemon
09/16 15:11:22<stoopkid> we made 4 type theory / lambdas languages in two weeks, with theorem provers, and that was when we didn't know what we were doing :P
09/16 15:13:25<stoopkid> btw, are you ontologiae ?
09/16 15:14:18<sirdancealot> alright
09/16 15:14:19<sirdancealot> no
09/16 15:14:40<stoopkid> ah
09/16 15:19:48<stoopkid> alright, so, are you ok  with incorporating these features into it? i don't think it should interfere with anything you've been building with the language-definition-language or editors for it, just maybe modularize the implementation somewhat for storage in the database-of-languages
09/16 15:21:56<sirdancealot> yea ill be happy if we work on something again
09/16 15:22:28<sirdancealot> i dont know where or how to start tho
09/16 15:24:02<stoopkid> let's start with a proof-of-concept of the database of languages; that's where it all begins in my mind
09/16 15:25:05<stoopkid> we can get me into the editor by making the goal be to be able to use the editor like an IDE for any language in the database, using the menus to be able to switch out what language you're using and to execute commands or w/e
09/16 15:26:14<stoopkid> that is essentially what you had in mind with editor right?
09/16 15:27:49<sirdancealot> eventually yeah
09/16 15:28:56<stoopkid> alright cool. so, you mentioned earlier that you could immediately start building up the editor you want in qt
09/16 15:29:35<stoopkid> maybe we should build it up from the beginning in qt so we both learn a new language and go through the idea of what the editor should be together?
09/16 15:30:24<sirdancealot> sounds good, im just actually not sure about building it in c++, while the rest of stuff is in python
09/16 15:30:55<sirdancealot> and there are issues with using qt from python
09/16 15:32:22<sirdancealot> or nvm, i think its not really an issue that i'd have to give up my license for now
09/16 15:32:54<stoopkid> your pick, i'll be learning something new either way
09/16 15:33:41<stoopkid> so, yea, that's where i'd start is with the language-definitions database
09/16 15:34:07<stoopkid> so with that i'd start by making a list of standard supporting tools you'll find for a language
09/16 15:34:19<stoopkid> like, an interpreter, a compiler, a parser, etc..
09/16 15:35:30<stoopkid> and then we make standard ways for how you can call these kinds of tools on programs written in the languages
09/16 15:36:28<stoopkid> so, you somehow indicate to the database what a particular tool is, like for example the interpreters we built for the lambdas languages, we'd indicate that they're interpreters
09/16 15:37:12<stoopkid> doesn't matter whether the thing you're calling an interpreter is actually a valid interpreter or even a working program, you just need to be able to find all the things that are *supposed* to be interpreters, or compilers, or etc..
09/16 15:37:25<stoopkid> from the menu, in the editor
09/16 15:38:11<stoopkid> then there would be a standard calling convention for each of these, so that you can actually use them
09/16 15:38:55<stoopkid> and whether or not they work is up to the code of that particular program, we don't need to go overkill with verified parsers and interpreters and such just yet we're just making a proof-of-concept and an outline
09/16 15:41:23<stoopkid> alright so, there might be some tricky parts to this wrt storing the interpreter/compiler/parser programs in a database, but the idea is straight-forward enough and those are just tricky parts with the implementation
09/16 15:41:42<stoopkid> i don't think it's anything we can't handle after our jit compilers and such
09/16 15:42:24<stoopkid> and i may or may not be overthinking it, you might already see simple ways to handle it, idk
09/16 15:43:19<stoopkid> the shell we'd build up as an entirely separate component from all this
09/16 15:44:24<stoopkid> imo it's purpose should just be to interface to the system and integrate the other tools, i.e. the language-definitions-database, logic, etc..
09/16 15:45:17<stoopkid> the shell just exposes the system to the editors or the logic, etc..


09/16 15:47:52<sirdancealot> well as on the database, the current state of things is: lemon nodes serialized in json, bash scripts and data files laying around, plain text laying around or stuffed into lemon nodes serialized in json
09/16 15:49:04<sirdancealot> whats still missing is a triplestore and a system of projecting the concepts in it to nodes (more complex language) and back
09/16 15:52:54<editable-koo>the work has to be done at some point, just not sure when
09/16 15:53:17<stoopkid> yea i guess we don't need to change anything about how it's set up now in order to get a proof-of-concept
09/16 15:53:30<stoopkid> wrt language-definition-database
09/16 15:54:21<editable-koo>yeah, we can look at lemon modules as a database
09/16 15:55:59<stoopkid> alright so, i'd say there's multiple things still missing: logic system (triple-store), CNL prototype, voice-to-CNL, and shell
09/16 15:57:27<stoopkid> voice-to-CNL is dependent on CNL, and CNL is dependent on the logic system, as far as i'm concerned
09/16 15:58:00<stoopkid> shell is independent though, it simply exposes the system to the editors and logic
09/16 15:58:20<editable-koo>well, if you want to have a combined logic-system-triple-store is a question
09/16 15:59:13<stoopkid> why not, that's what we have in tau already, just without the extra MLTT goodness
09/16 16:00:08<editable-koo>we actually dont have a triplestore in tau, neither do we have an python orm in it
09/16 16:00:39<stoopkid> quad-store*
09/16 16:01:40<editable-koo>sept-store*
09/16 16:02:11<stoopkid> the only difference is that you actually need 4 to run the logic, you don't need 7
09/16 16:02:28<editable-koo>sex-store?
09/16 16:02:44<stoopkid> don't need 6 either, sounds fun though
09/16 16:03:01<editable-koo>pent-store
09/16 16:03:19<editable-koo>yea so
09/16 16:03:45<editable-koo>so, ive been listening to justin bieber last two days
09/16 16:03:59<stoopkid> that's never a good sign :P
09/16 16:04:47<editable-koo>i didnt know
09/16 16:06:06<stoopkid> so, triple-store/quad-store/MLTT, whatever it is, we want to map the complex concepts in it to vocabulary, we agree on that much
09/16 16:07:07<editable-koo>the whole playlist is kinda half-crappy, i dont know why ive kept it running apparently on repeat for past two days, but hey its not really bad at all
09/16 16:07:37<stoopkid> i've honestly never heard any of it, i'm just jumping on the bandwagon of people making fun of him heh
09/16 16:07:54<editable-koo>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK_0jXPuIr0
09/16 16:08:22<editable-koo>i suppose this doesnt get you the same autoplay playlist as to me so its out of context, but judge for yourself
09/16 16:09:11<editable-koo>theres this kind of new dance-pop that youtube keeps pushing on me, i dont think its great but i dont mind it either
09/16 16:09:40<editable-koo>it usually jumps to it from something else that i explicitly play
09/16 16:12:06<editable-koo>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyEuk8j8imI
09/16 16:12:09<editable-koo>not bad
09/16 16:13:05<editable-koo>there may be another aspect to this: if this was sung in czech, id prolly vomit right away
09/16 16:13:43<editable-koo>i dont find my ears can stand the same amount of primitivity of lyrics that english language somehow makes okay
09/16 16:15:06<stoopkid> lol
09/16 16:15:07<editable-koo>in czech music i look for wit and wordplay
09/16 16:15:30<editable-koo>in english i guess i mostly cant appreciate it even if i stumble upon it lol
09/16 16:16:32<stoopkid> you find a lot more of that in rap
09/16 16:18:30<editable-koo>im not well-versed in english language rap
09/16 16:18:56<editable-koo>ventured a bit into eminem the other week
09/16 16:19:44<stoopkid> do you know atmosphere?
09/16 16:21:33<editable-koo>nope..
09/16 16:22:54<stoopkid> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nMpsiVPQzU
09/16 16:27:08<stoopkid> or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXZgf9wq-IU
09/16 16:29:18<editable-koo>interesting
09/16 16:29:23<editable-koo>gotta go grab some food
09/16 16:29:56<stoopkid> and then you gotta know some biggie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN2VKL-4Pj4
09/16 16:33:07<stoopkid> let's see, where's the good eminem
09/16 16:33:15<stoopkid> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp0qv3NHrYE
09/16 16:45:42<stoopkid> binary star's pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLraLApzXO8
09/16 16:48:41<stoopkid> wu tang clan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIPfQ-HtYeM
09/16 16:50:57<stoopkid> mobb deep: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NUX4tW5pps
09/16 16:51:23<stoopkid> anyway, that's a good start to find the real shit
09/16 16:54:03<stoopkid> so, anyway, we'd build up some system where we're defining logic, triplestore/quadstore/MLTT-kb, and we want to map the concepts in this database to vocabulary
09/16 16:55:23<sirdancealot> ya brain damage
09/16 16:55:42<sirdancealot> atmosphere is simplish but not terrible
09/16 16:57:05<stoopkid> eminem's got some really good stuff i just can't remember what most of it's called
09/16 16:58:01<sirdancealot> ya he does
09/16 17:00:16<stoopkid> so, we'd have some work to do to figure out how a language made in lemon could reference a database of vocabulary
09/16 17:01:37<stoopkid> i.e. for a CNL extensible with vocabulary and it's meaning stored in a database, i.e. it's dictionary
09/16 17:02:19<stoopkid> well, for proof of concept maybe there wouldn't be quite so much work to do for that
09/16 17:03:02*** Quit: ontologiae (~ontologia@79.98.21.80) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 265 seconds
09/16 17:04:04<stoopkid> so, if you were gonna set up GF for the voice-to-code, then the logical framework might as well be MLTT since GF is based on dependent type theory
09/16 17:06:59<stoopkid> whatever other thing you might want to work in, like pure triple store or w/e, can be recovered from MLTT, i.e. we can take a restricted subset of MLTT that only let's you build objects in a triple-store type
09/16 17:07:35<stoopkid> so, nothing lost there, the full MLTT is just available
09/16 17:07:59<stoopkid> and it'll need to be because the CNL i'd define is based on it
09/16 17:10:24<stoopkid> so, i'd start with a basic CNL that's essentially just a 1:1 translation of type theory into english
09/16 17:10:45<stoopkid> or into some abstract syntax and then into the concrete syntax english
09/16 17:11:36<stoopkid> so, then we'd get the voice-to-CNL set up, and we'd have voice-controlled-reasoner
09/16 17:12:25<stoopkid> parallel to this, we have the shell, which exposes the computer to the rest of the system
09/16 17:14:08<stoopkid> when both are complete, the concepts defining the exposed computer can be mapped into the logic, and the voice-controlled-reasoner can be made to operate over this data, and effect it, thereby giving full system control to the user
09/16 17:14:33<stoopkid> affect*
09/16 17:16:40<stoopkid> the  languages in the database of languages can be applied to the data exposed by the shell in order to view it better, like you want to disassemble some binary into a language you define, or you want to open up the file, select parts of it and decompile them in different ways
09/16 17:17:37<stoopkid> thus the combination of shell + language-definition-language + language-definition-database + general editor over this makes for a pretty fancy dev & reverse-engineering tool-set
09/16 17:17:59<stoopkid> and then if you throw the logic in there you can do even fancier reverse-engineering and debugging, using automated logic
09/16 17:19:23<stoopkid> spread code out over a database so that you can do look-ups against it, all kinds of stuff
09/16 17:19:39<stoopkid> over the* database
09/16 17:20:03<stoopkid> this is more or less what i've got in mind, how do you feel about it?
09/16 17:25:59<stoopkid> btw we can just simply use GF as the logic for the proof-of-concept, since it's a dependent type theory system so i can easily base a functioning CNL off of it
09/16 17:31:45<stoopkid> so, this whole thing with disassembling binaries and decompiling assembly or data, seeing a layered view through the compilation, which is indexed to find what parts in one map to what parts in the other, and why, is part of my dream dev/reverse-engineering toolkit
09/16 17:32:39<sirdancealot> sounds alright
09/16 17:34:18<stoopkid> cool, so, i'm thinking that to get full system control, we model our ISAs as langs with lemon, and describe them in the logic
09/16 17:34:43<stoopkid> they're simple languages, and this has us jumping immediately to full system control
09/16 17:35:23<stoopkid> then it's "just" a matter of building over top of that and simplifying back to the high-level view of the system we typically work with
09/16 17:36:58<stoopkid> seem reasonable?
09/16 17:37:43<sirdancealot> kinda
09/16 17:38:23<stoopkid> anything seem unreasonable?
09/16 17:38:41<sirdancealot> not yet
09/16 17:42:18<stoopkid> alright, so, that's my full plan at this point. i guess if the first step is to get the logic component integrated into it then i'd say that means integrating GF into it, for the proof-of-concept
09/16 17:42:52<stoopkid> it'll mimic an MLTT database until we need an actual one
09/16 17:43:23<stoopkid> and let's us jump into voice-to-CNL (and CNL design generally) much quicker
09/16 17:45:19<sirdancealot> sorry i think im gonna nap
09/16 17:45:24<stoopkid> np
09/16 17:46:50<stoopkid> so, GF would serve the dual purpose of acting as a logic database and an extension of the language-definition system beyond CFG
09/16 17:47:55<sirdancealot> i dont think you can make it act as a database
09/16 17:48:23<stoopkid> we can make it act as a proof-of-concept of what a database of it could do though, that's all i mean
09/16 17:48:45<sirdancealot> dunno
09/16 17:51:32<stoopkid> a database of it would just be splitting up it's different terms into records in persistent storage, so, an agda or GF file is already acting as a form of database that just isn't built to scale to a database's needs
09/16 17:53:13<stoopkid> they're built to run programs defined with terms, not run databases defined with terms, but that's effectively the only difference
09/16 17:54:17<stoopkid> like in tau's design, it's more database than program, or intended to be
09/16 17:54:26<stoopkid> same thing here, that's all it is
09/16 17:56:06<stoopkid> so, an agda/GF file works just as well, it's just limited in scalability
09/16 17:56:57<stoopkid> we'd go with GF ofc, since that's got the support for CNL to get us right on track to finish up the proof-of-concept without an excruciating amount of effort
09/16 17:58:13<stoopkid> so, ultimately GF will become just an extension of the language-definition system, but for the proof-of-concept it can serve as the database
09/16 17:59:03<stoopkid> and if it can't for some reason (like inability to lookup terms, like you can in agda), then we'd use agda instead, and i'd incorporate the relevant features from GF into agda
09/16 18:00:04<stoopkid> or maybe a reworking of tau's system to incorporate the MLTT
09/16 18:00:17<stoopkid> yea probably that rather than agda since agda just gets us off track
09/16 18:00:33<stoopkid> but this only if GF can't work even for a proof-of-concept for some reason
09/16 18:01:56<stoopkid> for exposing the computer through the shell, idk, you've got a lot more experience there than i do
09/16 18:03:30<stoopkid> once it's exposed i can tell you how to manipulate it, but it would take me some effort to figure out how to expose the system on a level that matches the ISA logic
09/16 18:03:53<stoopkid> (the ISA logic that gets encoded into the logical framework, i mean)
09/16 18:06:32<stoopkid> so, i think to split that up, we both study the ISAs, but you focus on exposing them through the shell, and i focus on modeling them in the logic and receiving the exposed data into it
09/16 18:08:56<stoopkid> it's a lot, but the idea is that this system would allow us to extend more whenever we need it
09/16 18:15:58<stoopkid> anyway, we don't actually need to do the whole ISA thing for the proof of concept and actually run our computers, we can use an extremely simplified ISA with just a couple instructions and an extremely simplified model of a computer, and show how you can tell the computer to do things with it or ask the computer questions about it, and that the logical
              <stoopkid> framework actually allows it to reason out an answer, or figure out how to do something, all by voice commands
09/16 18:17:17<stoopkid> so, i could just model a simple computer with a simple instruction set and a shell for it within the logic, and we could use that to demonstrate the proof-of-concept
09/16 18:18:33<stoopkid> ok, so, this gets back to "why modularize it all", especially with the language-definitions-and-supporting-tools part
09/16 18:19:30<stoopkid> we want to be able to use this as a shell and get all these nice features like plugging in support for new languages and interpreting data with the languages into the logic
09/16 18:19:37<stoopkid> and we want to be able to do it with our actual computers
09/16 18:21:04<stoopkid> but our actual computers are really complex beasts, with layers and layers of languages and structures upon structures of components
09/16 18:25:35<stoopkid> we can certainly define some new language support when we're doing some reverse engineering of some code/data, and that's extremely useful, and something i definitely want out of this, but for this to ever scale up to something where we're examining and operating our computers with it,  we need to be able to plug in existing supporting tools for languages
09/16 18:28:02<stoopkid> that doesn't get those tools into the level of the logic, but it integrates them into the system for standard development, debugging and reverse-engineering
09/16 18:29:09<stoopkid> the logic describing all these things has to get built up over time. there's no way around it; for the logic to reason about these things, their theories must be described, and their theories are not currently described in terms of this logic
09/16 18:44:05<stoopkid> "how many partitions does my hard-drive have?"
09/16 20:35:59<stoopkid> so i guess for plugging in existing tools, we'll want to define APIs for the various types of tools, and then for each tool we can write scripts that run it under this API, so that it's use is accessible to the rest of the lemon system
09/16 20:39:07<stoopkid> so, for example, we might want to add gcc to it to compile our C language definition; so we use the API to interface to gcc, i.e. run it with some command line, for example
09/16 20:43:59<stoopkid> ok, so, cool
09/16 20:44:23<stoopkid> looks like it's a pretty sure thing that i'll be able to get some web dev work from my neighbor
09/16 20:45:54<stoopkid> and my dad's pushing me to do this so he'll understand if the timeframe it takes me to start making any money from it doesnt quite match with the timeframes they originally gave me to start paying rent
09/16 20:49:46<stoopkid> so, i'm starting to wonder if there's a correspondence between types and languages
09/16 20:50:09<stoopkid> there's a correspondence between types and categories, and a correspondence between categories and languages..
09/16 20:50:33<stoopkid> Data Nat = Zero | S Nat
09/16 20:50:41<stoopkid> seems like a CFG
09/16 20:51:46<stoopkid> especially when you consider that files/programs/data can be said to have a language and also can be said to have a type
09/16 20:51:57<stoopkid> and the language and the type don't seem to be particularly distinct
09/16 20:52:11<stoopkid> for example, consider the linux executable file format
09/16 20:52:28<stoopkid> it's got some file headers and such defining it as an executable
09/16 20:53:23<stoopkid> if you look at the headers, you could describe their contents, as some kind of language of data values, or some kind of type of data values, there's not much difference
09/16 20:54:48<stoopkid> there's only really a reason for a distinction when you consider a language that itself has types
09/16 20:55:28<stoopkid> but even then, the distinction seems to me to be probably artificial
09/16 20:56:53<stoopkid> take one of our CFGs
09/16 20:56:59<stoopkid> any of them
09/16 20:57:07<stoopkid> it makes an inductive type right?
09/16 20:57:33<stoopkid> this inductive type is the syntax of our language
09/16 21:02:17<stoopkid> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus#Syntax
09/16 21:02:44<stoopkid> Data BaseTypes = Int | Nat | String | Bool | ...
09/16 21:03:28<stoopkid> Data Type = BaseType | Type -> Type
09/16 21:06:25<stoopkid> Data Var = V VarIndex
09/16 21:06:55<stoopkid> Data VarIndex = VZero | VSuc VarIndex
09/16 21:08:15<sirdancealot> youre starting to wonder? i thought you were sure about this
09/16 21:08:21<sirdancealot> always affirming that i wasnt crazy
09/16 21:09:47<stoopkid> i mean a stronger / more direct correspondence than "type theory would be a good basis for the logic of a CNL"
09/16 21:10:09<stoopkid> and strong / more direct than "you can model languages in type theory"
09/16 21:10:13<stoopkid> stronger*
09/16 21:10:39<stoopkid> which is all the correspondence i've been going off of, which is still good enough for me
09/16 21:10:45<sirdancealot> hmm
09/16 21:11:31<stoopkid> so, i knew that languages corresponded to types, but what hadn't occurred to me until i said "i'm starting to wonder..." is that you might be able to say the reverse, that types correspond to languages
09/16 21:12:51<stoopkid> so this seems to reaffirm to me that modeling a language as a type in type theory isn't an iffy or radically experimental construction, it's following a fairly natural correspondence
09/16 21:13:48<sirdancealot> i really think we did go over this correspondences before
09/16 21:14:05<stoopkid> possibly
09/16 21:14:51<sirdancealot> what ive been doing in newshit is the other way around, language becomes a type system
09/16 21:15:41<sirdancealot> doesnt matter
09/16 21:17:21<stoopkid> so, wrt database, consider:
09/16 21:17:43<stoopkid> Data Person = stoopkid | sirdancealot | HMC | ...
09/16 21:19:12<sirdancealot> im not sure HMC subclasses from Human
09/16 21:19:28<stoopkid> touche
09/16 21:21:10<stoopkid> in any case, we could expand these data types to essentially be like relational database tables, like Data Person = Row1 | Row2 | ...
09/16 21:21:30<sirdancealot> why
09/16 21:22:15<stoopkid> i'm just saying you could. we can expand them into essentially any kind of database
09/16 21:22:21<sirdancealot> does this seem a better db to you than linked data?
09/16 21:22:37<stoopkid> yes
09/16 21:22:43<sirdancealot> why
09/16 21:23:57<stoopkid> where in linked data do you find any of this logical reasoning capacity?
09/16 21:24:12<sirdancealot> what reasoning?
09/16 21:24:43<stoopkid> any of it
09/16 21:25:19<stoopkid> i don't have ideas for how to build CNL over linked data, i do have ideas for how to build it over type theory though
09/16 21:25:41<stoopkid> because of the logical reasoning capacity
09/16 21:25:47<sirdancealot> what any?
09/16 21:26:22<sirdancealot> you mean mltt?
09/16 21:26:39<stoopkid> yes
09/16 21:27:18<stoopkid> this would be a martin-lof type theory database
09/16 21:29:51<stoopkid> so, consider an agda file which is like a program vs. tau's system which is like a db
09/16 21:30:02<stoopkid> we'd be like tau's db
09/16 21:30:46<stoopkid> we'd expand the programs (databases), index them, provide query support over them, and make them scalable like a db
09/16 21:31:23<stoopkid> in pretty much the same way that we do in tau, down to how the implementation works
09/16 21:32:25<stoopkid> o
09/16 21:33:34<stoopkid> ** i'm just pointing out that "Person a Type. stoopkid a Person. koo a Person. HMC a Person. ..." is the same as "Data Person = stoopkid | koo | HMC | .. "
09/16 21:36:32<stoopkid> ok so. how straightforward is it to hook voice to GF?
09/16 21:37:45<sirdancealot> pretty straightforward, apparently
09/16 21:39:36<sirdancealot> on what level should be the data in the db, lambda terms or more abstract?
09/16 21:40:24<stoopkid> i guess technically more abstract; they'd be the objects in these inductive types, or proofs of other types, sometimes lambda terms
09/16 21:41:03<stoopkid> think how you put a field type on a table in a relational database
09/16 21:41:41<sirdancealot> i really dont know what putting a field type on a table means
09/16 21:41:59<stoopkid> have you ever used SQL?
09/16 21:42:03<sirdancealot> yes
09/16 21:42:25<stoopkid> err, column* type
09/16 21:43:09<stoopkid> think of the product of column types, that defines essentially the record type defining that table, right
09/16 21:43:16<stoopkid> i.e. it's the type of the records (rows) in that table
09/16 21:43:37<stoopkid> except now instead of simple SQL record types we have general MLTT types
09/16 21:44:11<sirdancealot> shrug
09/16 21:44:40* stoopkid shrugs
09/16 21:45:56<stoopkid> you don't have to be impressed you just have to accept that i don't know any other way to make the fancy stuff work without making it totally ad hoc
09/16 21:46:09<stoopkid> (totally ad hoc and probably non-working)
09/16 21:47:20<stoopkid> i'm not saying it can't be done other ways, i'm sure it can, i'm just saying that *i* don't know how
09/16 21:49:07<stoopkid> just even the basic thing for voice-control, the CNL, i don't know how to make one that's actually suitable for giving complex commands or asking complex questions without using a type theory system
09/16 21:50:10<stoopkid> not just a type theory system but a type theory system split up into a database that can grow as new vocabulary and concepts are put into it
09/16 21:53:24<stoopkid> anyway, i don't really see any way that using an MLTT database limits or interferes with anything else in the system or even any way that it changes much of how things are expressed if you express them in the MLTT, it simply expands the system's logical capacity out to the full logical capacity it's "supposed" to have
09/16 21:54:46<stoopkid> just to emphasize this point, let's look at what GF is: a framework for describing CNL using dependent type theory
09/16 21:55:54* stoopkid shrugs
09/16 21:56:57<stoopkid> i don't think it can do any proper CNL without logical reasoning over a database of logical concepts, and i don't see any reason why that choice of logical reasoning framework wouldn't be MLTT
09/16 21:58:28<stoopkid> unless it was some variant that we decided was better for some reason, like a category-theoretical formulation of it, or HoTT
09/16 21:58:57<stoopkid> like, there's things that are a substitute for it, but it's not just linked data
09/16 22:00:23<stoopkid> "not", "and", "or", "implies", "forall", "there exists" <-- it needs logic, because humans speak in logic
09/16 22:00:35<stoopkid> and humans think in logic, and all math and reasoning is done in logic
09/16 22:01:29<stoopkid> if you have these things, and you implemented them appropriately, then you're back to a system of dependent type theory
09/16 22:01:52<stoopkid> if you're missing any one of these things i'll be like ??
09/16 22:02:42<sirdancealot> yea np
09/16 22:11:06<stoopkid> so wrt whether everything would be in lambdas or not; implicitly they would be but for example Data Bool = True | False isn't terrible lambdas, and variables of type Bool can compile down to bits
09/16 22:14:24<sirdancealot> terrible lambdas?
09/16 22:14:39<sirdancealot> so, no triplestore, not even a quadstore?
09/16 22:16:21<stoopkid> we could implement this in a quad store and then we have quad store + MLTT
09/16 22:17:18<sirdancealot> i dont think we should have both for the sake of it
09/16 22:18:09<stoopkid> then i'd have MLTT for the sake of it
09/16 22:21:02<stoopkid> maybe if it was a quadstore that was capable of logic with "not", "and", "or", "implies", "exists", and "forall", but then that would just be quadstore + MLTT again
09/16 22:22:24<sirdancealot> so what did you mean terrible lambdas?
09/16 22:22:50<stoopkid> i meant http://augustss.blogspot.com/2007/11
09/16 22:23:00<stoopkid> vs. Data Bool = True | False
09/16 22:23:24<stoopkid> terrible church-encodings*
09/16 22:25:06<sirdancealot>  you mean not that bad?
09/16 22:26:08<stoopkid> yea, Data Bool = True | False isn't nearly as bad as the church-encoding
09/16 22:27:00<sirdancealot> so youre saying we wont use lambdas here but something like TypeDeclaration?
09/16 22:28:03<sirdancealot> and Let?
09/16 22:28:38<stoopkid> yea we won't use lambdas to express our types through church-encodings, we'll just use these "inductive data types", and we won't use lambdas explicitly except for when we're actually talking about making a function
09/16 22:28:57<sirdancealot> ok
09/16 22:29:00<stoopkid> this is how it is in, say, agda, idris, haskell, etc...
09/16 22:30:07<stoopkid> so, we can always *interpret* these values as the church-encodings, but we don't ever have to write, store or manipulate them that way, until we specifically ask to check out the church-encoding
09/16 22:31:18<stoopkid> which would just be like, something you'd do in the editor, out of curiosity, maybe for a sanity check of some aspect of your code, idk, but we wouldn't  be coding in church-encodings at all, generally
09/16 22:32:21<stoopkid> so, the syntax of the language also doesn't have to be anything like agda, idris, haskell, etc..
09/16 22:32:45<stoopkid> i don't really care what the language is as much as i care that it maps to the right logic

09/17 22:31:00<stoopkid> after thinking about it for a bit, i think we should go with an MLTT-in-quad-store system, ultimately
09/17 22:31:56<stoopkid> you want a triple/quad-store, i want a triple/quad-store, but i also want an MLTT, and currently tau's kb design is as good a way to get MLTT as a database as i know of, so, we might as well

09/17 23:28:13<stoopkid> i think we've got a couple things that still need to be worked out even for a PoC
09/17 23:28:54<stoopkid> particularly i wouldn't want to jump into any GUI work until we.... "storyboard" it? i'm not sure what the right word is here
09/17 23:30:06<stoopkid> we should play around with GF and get a good feel with it before we jump into trying to integrate it

09/18 12:50:49<stoopkid> yea, i think we should start by story-boarding the UX
09/18 13:35:47<stoopkid> http://www.grammaticalframework.org/
09/18 13:36:08<stoopkid> in the "What is GF" section, we should try out some of those other systems it mentions
09/18 13:36:32<stoopkid> also in the Projects section
09/18 13:37:38<stoopkid> i was wondering how we were gonna do the initial CNL, but no need:
 http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html
09/18 13:38:24<stoopkid> no need to roll it ourselves, i mean

09/18 17:48:17<stoopkid> i'm installing GF now then i'm gonna try some of the speech recognition systems
09/18 18:20:03<stoopkid> hrm, having some trouble getting it installed
09/18 18:20:37<stoopkid> or, at least it says it installed but the command "gf" doesn't work and i can't find whatever bin files it's supposed to be associated to
09/18 18:22:17<stoopkid> apparently we can use it from python somehow i'm still trying to figure out how to set that up though
09/18 19:04:29<stoopkid> alright i've got it set up and displaying parse-trees of the "Hello" grammar in graphviz
09/18 19:07:18<stoopkid> alright so i guess i should go through their tutorial and then dig into the standard library and get familiar with their english lib
09/18 19:18:11<stoopkid> so, i don't think we can do the full CNL in GF
09/18 19:18:29<stoopkid> well, lemme rephrase, i'm not sure if we can
09/18 19:19:26<stoopkid> depends on whether GF has enough support to step outside of dependent type theory and do arbitrary computation so that we can actually express the full type theory within the language
09/18 19:21:15<stoopkid> if it can't, then i think we'll ultimately have to roll our own dependent type theory system with an extralogical CNL syntax, since we can't model the full type theory as an object within the type theory without the MLTT self-interpreter
09/18 19:27:22<stoopkid> actually, we did the whole syntax in CFG, so it's definitely powerful enough to parse it's own syntax
09/18 19:31:20<stoopkid> so, then what would be necessary.. it would need to be able to map that syntax into the appropriate types
09/18 19:31:25<stoopkid> and terms
09/18 19:35:24<sirdancealot> storyboarding the ux...i have something better, a working proof of concept
09/18 19:36:53<stoopkid> alright well if you just wanna wing it i'm fine with that
09/18 19:37:18-e- [global notice] Hi all. Our Tor hidden service is back online, and available at <freenodeok2gncmy.onion>. For more information, please read <https://freenode.net/news/tor-online>.
09/18 19:39:04<sirdancealot> well i mean you should first try it out before we speak of a more advanced ui
09/18 19:39:19<sirdancealot> <stoopkid> in the "What is GF" section, we
09/18 19:39:20<sirdancealot> should try out some of those other systems it mentions
09/18 19:39:21<sirdancealot> why?
09/18 19:39:53<sirdancealot> projects section is more interesting..
09/18 19:43:06<stoopkid> idk, simpler & more specific functionality, for standard prog-langs
09/18 19:46:22<stoopkid> hrm, what we could do is just use GF to handle parsing for the lang, since we know that MLTT can theoretically be expressed in just CFG, which is definitely within the capacity of GF
09/18 19:46:38<stoopkid> err, not just theoretically, we've done it, i meant hypothetically
09/18 19:48:32<editable-koo>yea, GF is for parsing, i think thats the idea
09/18 19:49:09<editable-koo>im tired...but keep it up
09/18 19:52:09<stoopkid> hrm, so i guess maybe we should have GF just for parsing and then maybe we'd want to map parse-trees into another MLTT lang like agda/idris that can handle their type-checking & compilation
09/18 19:55:38<stoopkid> problem is this doesn't have either the CNL or the MLTT hooked up to anything extensible like a database
09/18 19:57:38<editable-koo>what is "the CNL"?
09/18 19:58:21<stoopkid> the CNL that we'd use for the voice-control
09/18 19:58:40<stoopkid> just the language structures, as opposed to logic structures
09/18 19:59:06<sirdancealot> still no clue
09/18 19:59:56<stoopkid> about what
09/18 20:00:05<sirdancealot> what you mean
09/18 20:01:07<stoopkid> CNL built in GF provides the syntax, logical constructions in MLTT provide the semantics
09/18 20:04:19<stoopkid> idk, does that make sense?
09/18 20:04:46<sirdancealot> no
09/18 20:05:01<stoopkid> what doesn't make sense
09/18 20:05:41<sirdancealot> for example, i sometimes speak of a language definition language or of lemon language in general
09/18 20:05:47<sirdancealot> or of the mltt lc
09/18 20:05:52<sirdancealot> or of narsese
09/18 20:06:12<sirdancealot> what are you speaking of?
09/18 20:06:44<stoopkid> a controlled natural language that you could actually use for a voice-controlled computer
09/18 20:07:57<sirdancealot> do you have a concrete vision of the language?
09/18 20:08:27<stoopkid> for a proof-of-concept it would basically just be a clunky 1:1 mapping of a simplified MLTT into english
09/18 20:09:24<stoopkid> like those examples we were working out a couple months ago
09/18 20:09:39<sirdancealot> ok so lets call it mltt cnl?
09/18 20:09:53<stoopkid> sure
09/18 20:11:04<sirdancealot> now, what is "extensible like a database"?
09/18 20:12:00<stoopkid> like remember how i showed you how an agda program can be interpreted like a database
09/18 20:12:45<sirdancealot> well, its kind of a stretch to say it can
09/18 20:12:46<stoopkid> except that there's little to no capacity to use it like a database in terms of CRUD and it's not really scalable along those lines
09/18 20:13:28<sirdancealot> it can be interpreted as a set of definitions
09/18 20:14:00<stoopkid> right, it's got all the stuff that would be put into a database but it's not a database it's a prog-lang/prover
09/18 20:14:20<sirdancealot> yea ok
09/18 20:20:21<stoopkid> so, ultimately we'd want something more like a database. i'm not even sure how well we'd do just for a PoC with just something like agda. apparently isabelle is an MLTT system that's more like a db
09/18 20:21:17<stoopkid> maybe
09/18 20:21:20<stoopkid> i might be wrong about that
09/18 20:21:49<stoopkid> could be implemented with a relational db though
09/18 20:22:50<stoopkid> types would be tables, objects would be records in the tables, we'd use something like agda's type-checker to type-check rather than use the relational db's column types
09/18 20:23:21<stoopkid> or the same general idea but with a quad-store
09/18 20:23:47<sirdancealot> quad-store sounds much saner
09/18 20:24:10<sirdancealot> still not sure what exactly is your usecase with the db
09/18 20:24:36<stoopkid> that's where concepts & their vocab gets stored
09/18 20:24:45<sirdancealot> like, adding stuff to it, querying against it
09/18 20:24:58<stoopkid> right
09/18 20:25:58<sirdancealot> newshit has this role filled by modules, you could say
09/18 20:26:02<sirdancealot> or how to put it better
09/18 20:26:22<sirdancealot> you can add a module, add stuff to a module, use stuff from a module
09/18 20:28:01<stoopkid> basically how i'm imagining it is that questions expressed in the CNL would end up as propositions/types and the proving process would be invoked
09/18 20:29:23<sirdancealot> i can trivially set this up
09/18 20:29:44<stoopkid> cool :)
09/18 20:30:37<stoopkid> so, that's not really where the database aspect would come in, that would come in when you wanna say things like "koo is a person"
09/18 20:32:32<sirdancealot> ultimately its an ui issue
09/18 20:32:43<sirdancealot> in the normal world we have repls and we have files
09/18 20:33:37<sirdancealot> there may be something in between, and something entirely different, some "chat with your computer" kind of modality, dunno
09/18 20:33:48<sirdancealot> but i think these are all just different ui modalities to explore
09/18 20:35:16<stoopkid> sure
09/18 20:35:46<sirdancealot> some may be implemented by creating a superset of the language itself
09/18 20:36:02<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
09/18 20:36:03<sirdancealot> like, "add <x>, query <x>..
09/18 20:36:21<sirdancealot> where x is some mltt for example
09/18 20:38:17<stoopkid> yea that's basically how i'm imagining it, you get a really simple sub-lang that lets you control mltt a really simple sub-lang that *is* mltt, and then whatever you add to the database can extend this into a more complete CNL which has ability for complex propositions to be automatically answered about it
09/18 20:39:10<sirdancealot> ok cool, glad we got this sorted out
09/18 20:39:38<stoopkid> same, so does this make sense? are you alright with this design?
09/18 20:40:04<sirdancealot> sure
09/18 20:41:56<stoopkid> so, i'd imagine that this database would also correspond to that "organize everything" database we were talking about
09/18 20:42:02<stoopkid> ultimately
09/18 20:42:20<stoopkid> you organize everything, and then you can talk about it
09/18 20:42:28<sirdancealot> yea
09/18 20:43:21<stoopkid> so, would you agree this seems doable? at least a basic PoC
09/18 20:43:42<stoopkid> not necessarily including the "organize everything db"
09/18 20:45:25<sirdancealot> what i have in newshit is: there is a module, that has lines where you can add definitions and stuff
09/18 20:45:47<sirdancealot> now, a bit below it you can have a "repl" kind of module, or you can think of the module as a repl
09/18 20:46:02<sirdancealot> currently F7 evaluates current line
09/18 20:46:21<sirdancealot> the repl module has the definitions of the first module visible in its scope
09/18 20:46:41<sirdancealot> this pretty much is it, the simplest implementation
09/18 20:47:04<sirdancealot> we could extend the repl language with those "add" and "query"
09/18 20:47:36<sirdancealot> we could make it behave more repl-ish and evaluate upon pressing return
09/18 20:47:58<sirdancealot> we can reimplement this concept in a cli ui one way or another
09/18 20:48:20<stoopkid> so is the add persistent or non-persistent? (doesn't really matter for PoC, just curious)
09/18 20:48:47<sirdancealot> the add is made persistent by pressing ctrl-s
09/18 20:49:23<stoopkid> sounds logical :)
09/18 20:50:41<stoopkid> k so. could we use this for adding MLTT types & terms to the MLTT we built?
09/18 20:57:38<sirdancealot> yes we can use this for the mltt language we build
09/18 20:57:50<sirdancealot> built
09/18 21:00:15<stoopkid> ok cool, so, that lets us add more logical concepts. still have the problem though that the vocab doesn't make it back into the CNL in GF
09/18 21:02:36<sirdancealot> well, we need a variation on the integration of marpa into newshit
09/18 21:05:04<stoopkid> what kind of variation?
09/18 21:11:42<sirdancealot> in newshit, grammar is generated for the current cursor position
09/18 21:11:50<sirdancealot> based on static scope
09/18 21:16:55<stoopkid> hrm, not sure what you mean; that's not how we did the mltt grammar
09/18 21:18:11<sirdancealot> you never saw it in the gui
09/18 21:20:53<stoopkid> i guess i need to set up the gui here and check that out
09/18 21:21:21<sirdancealot> yeah that could help
09/18 21:28:41<sirdancealot> we did it, in the sense that we built up a module containing mltt language definitions, then created another module that had the first module in scope, then the cli took some text input and pasted it into a Parser in the second module and called parse()
09/18 21:28:44<sirdancealot> see cli.py
09/18 21:30:13<sirdancealot> m.collect_grammar(scope,...)
09/18 21:31:21<stoopkid> i see
09/18 21:33:09<sirdancealot> so, i can do the same with gf
09/18 21:34:47<sirdancealot> although this is essentially a hack extending the CFGness provided by marpa and it gets uply..
09/18 21:36:16<stoopkid> alright i'm running the lemon operating language
09/18 21:36:54<sirdancealot> lol
09/18 21:41:14<stoopkid> how we'd basically just reparse with GF each time we add something?
09/18 21:48:28<stoopkid> s/how/so/
09/18 21:51:23<stoopkid> that's fine for PoC, but it's also why we'd eventually want something like an actual database
09/18 21:52:24<sirdancealot> what does an actual database solve?
09/18 21:52:29<sirdancealot> reparse what?
09/18 21:55:20<stoopkid> like we need to be able to add vocabulary
09/18 21:56:05<sirdancealot> you mean we re-generate the grammar each time we add something?
09/18 21:56:13<stoopkid> right
09/18 21:58:22<sirdancealot> lets first consider what lets say python does
09/18 21:58:31<sirdancealot> for i in bananas: print(i)
09/18 21:59:54<sirdancealot> the grammar is: for <identifier> in <expression>: <statement>
09/18 22:00:01<sirdancealot> function call is a statement
09/18 22:00:18<sirdancealot> <identifier>(<expression>) is a function call
09/18 22:01:32<sirdancealot> identifier is a sequence of characters without space
09/18 22:03:31<sirdancealot> first theres a parsing phase, next there is a phase where identifiers are looked up (at run time, but doesnt matter)
09/18 22:05:58<sirdancealot> i wonder if this process would allow spaces in idenfiers
09/18 22:08:04<stoopkid> i gotta run for a bit but i'll read when i get back
09/18 22:08:08<sirdancealot> now, i have a more free system where anything can serve as an identifier
09/18 22:08:37<sirdancealot> so, the grammar is ambiguous
09/18 22:11:46<sirdancealot> so, one option i see is that my grammar would be similar to above, and i end up with a parse forest every time
09/18 22:13:11<sirdancealot> then have a phase that cleans that up, guessing something along the lines that a for loop with a loop variable that's later printed is more probable than a long two-line identifier
09/18 22:13:56<sirdancealot> the option i chose is that my grammar doesnt say that <identifier>(<expression>) is a function call
09/18 22:14:51<sirdancealot> instead the grammar is generated for the exact spot after the ":" and contains the rule that "print(" < experssion> ")" is a function call
09/18 22:15:19<sirdancealot> because it saw the print defun in scope
09/18 22:17:06<sirdancealot> i havent even fully implemented this yet and i think i could see some problems with it, but w/e
09/18 22:17:27<sirdancealot> now, your idea probably is that this all is handled in the code for the grammar, inside gf
09/18 22:17:55<sirdancealot> again we dont know how well or for what cases this is gonna work
09/18 22:24:08<sirdancealot>  so..i hope we eventually learn ..
09/18 22:25:41<sirdancealot> not sure what your idea of a solution involving a real db is
09/18 22:30:05<sirdancealot> ofc i want a real db, my idea is that such db will store lemon nodes, but im open to different ways
09/18 22:31:36<sirdancealot> and my idea is a triplestore, because i know that ill be able to query it in different ways, have data and metadata,
09/18 22:31:57<sirdancealot> i guess metadata is something i dont see how would work if our db was a tree of mltt nodes
09/19 00:38:34<stoopkid> ah
09/19 00:38:51<stoopkid> we'd need at least some of it to be outside of mltt
09/19 00:39:43<stoopkid> well, maybe; depends what you mean
09/19 00:39:54<stoopkid> you can have data and metadata in mltt too
09/19 00:40:07<stoopkid> metadata is just data about some other data
09/19 00:43:39<stoopkid> wrt database, we don't want to have to recompile all the knowledge encoded in MLTT every time we add/change some information
09/19 00:45:14<stoopkid> like if we had agda files where all the knowledge was encoded into MLTT, we'd have to compile it in order to make it usable in some way
09/19 00:46:04<stoopkid> we don't want to have recompile the whole thing, we only want to recompile the pieces that are affected by a change
09/19 00:46:23<stoopkid> like a database; only the parts that are affected even have to be considered during an update
09/19 00:47:23<stoopkid> that's one piece. next is scalability. there's a huge amount of vocabulary and concepts, at the very least we'll end up wanting to index this in various ways
09/19 00:48:29<stoopkid> plus we'll want to use the database for other things, sticking other kinds of information into it; we want to be able to attach vocabulary to these things and then have that become usable in the CNL
09/19 00:49:05<stoopkid> i really think MLTT-database would be useful by itself
09/19 00:49:27<stoopkid> it's a worthy product by itself; consider it an evolution beyond graph-db & linked data
09/19 00:51:48<stoopkid> consider that there's not many databases that can store functions, proofs, propositions, objects of abstract algebra, etc..
09/19 00:51:52<stoopkid> (if any?)
09/19 00:54:10<stoopkid> anyway, i'm flexible as to how this actually ends up getting stored
09/19 00:54:18<stoopkid> "i guess metadata is something i dont see how would work if our db was a tree of mltt nodes"
09/19 00:55:01<stoopkid> i don't see why you couldn't add extra information in there as long as you can extract just the mltt structure back out of it
09/19 00:57:51<stoopkid> ah, i see what you mean
09/19 00:58:05<stoopkid> if you metadata outside of mltt you can't use mltt to query it, sure
09/19 00:58:14<stoopkid> if you have*
09/19 00:59:25<stoopkid> so, my ultimate suggestion here would be to find a way to model both your data and your metadata in mltt
09/19 00:59:56<stoopkid> then both your data and metadata can be talked about by the same CNL we build for MLTT
09/19 01:00:38<stoopkid> if you want to put your metadata outside of MLTT, and still have it talked about by CNL, we mostly likely end up with a pretty schizo language
09/19 01:01:03<stoopkid> one way to handle this would just be to make it a different language to talk about the triple stores
09/19 01:01:29<stoopkid> or perhaps make a basic language that's interoperable with both the MLTT-CNL and the triple-store-CNL
09/19 01:01:57<stoopkid> now, this gets into something i was thinking about but didn't want to get into yet because... complicated..
09/19 01:03:17<stoopkid> humans don't just understand one CNL, we understand any lang we're taught to interpret, and we can mix them together to express concepts
09/19 01:04:03<stoopkid> like in our editor, we're gonna make it so you can switch out what lang you're using, or even have it parse some documents in different ways in different places
09/19 01:04:25<stoopkid> this is eventually sort of how i imagine the CNL being, by analogy
09/19 01:05:42<stoopkid> so, it wouldn't just be one language, it would be a system of logic that "knows" languages, and can learn more, and try to inference the language being used in a given situation
09/19 01:06:00<stoopkid> but, no need to get into that complexity yet
09/19 01:06:35<stoopkid> just saying, down the road i honestly imagine this turning into something that could be used as the basis for a robot brain
09/19 01:17:11<stoopkid> so, what the MLTT does is get us a natural, machine-interpretable logic, that corresponds closely to basic human logic, as well as human language (because our language naturally mirrors this logic)
09/19 01:19:17<stoopkid> "a person and a dog", "a person or a dog", "there is a person with a dog", "every person has a dog"
09/19 01:19:32<stoopkid> "a dog is an animal", "Fido is a dog"
09/19 01:20:28<stoopkid> ok so. we want it to be able to reason over statements of arbitrary logical complexity
09/19 01:21:00<stoopkid> i'll tolerate lack of linguistic complexity as long as it's got a full correspondence to logic
09/19 01:21:45<stoopkid> because then i know that even if i can't express my thoughts using my normal vocabulary, there is at least some way to express any logical concept/proposition i can imagine
09/19 01:22:04<stoopkid> cause if it can't do this, it's not gonna handle full CNL with linguistic complexity
09/19 01:23:03<stoopkid> so, natural languages aren't much like MLTT languages, like agda
09/19 01:23:34<stoopkid> but they allow us to communicate a concepts in a logic that *is* much like MLTT
09/19 01:28:00<stoopkid> so, i imagine we'd have a basic MLTT language allowing us to form MLTT expressions using concepts & vocabulary coming from a database
09/19 01:28:59<stoopkid> "A and B", "A or B", "there exists an object x in A such that B", "for every object x in A, B"
09/19 01:30:13<stoopkid> any valid types stored in the database would be usable in forming expressions like this
09/19 01:32:05<stoopkid> likewise you'd have objects of those types stored in the database
09/19 01:41:34<stoopkid> idk though there's a decent amount of work to do to sort out what should go where
09/19 01:42:06<stoopkid> some things that correspond to types in MLTT would correspond to something like database tables
09/19 01:42:23<stoopkid> other things that correspond to types in MLTT would correspond to something like queries against the database
09/19 01:45:42<stoopkid> other things don't even correspond to things "within" MLTT, for example the statement "Fido is a dog" is neither a term nor a type, it's a judgement
09/19 01:51:59*** Quit: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@109.107.211.244) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 265 seconds
09/19 01:55:48<stoopkid>   and then things like inductive types actually technically correspond to adding new deduction rules
09/19 01:56:43<stoopkid> so, there's 4 langs involved in MLTT: natural deduction, judgements, types/propositions, and objects/proofs
09/19 01:58:13<stoopkid> "data Nat = Zero | S Nat" is the same as:
09/19 01:58:18<stoopkid>  --------------------
09/19 01:58:24<stoopkid> Zero : Nat
09/19 01:58:25<stoopkid>  
09/19 01:58:40<stoopkid> G |- x : Nat
09/19 01:58:42<stoopkid> ---------------
09/19 01:58:51<stoopkid> G |- S x : Nat
09/19 02:05:07<stoopkid> anyway, let's not start with the CNL. we need to do a lot of work there
09/19 02:05:28<stoopkid> what i'd like to see first is using it as a language-definitions-and-tools-database
09/19 02:18:44<stoopkid> so, i'd wanna set up a plug-in system in order to be able to incorporate outside tools
09/19 03:15:45<stoopkid> so, there's 2 kinds of judgements, first is that some object is an element of some type, and the second is that two objects are defined to be equal
09/19 03:17:29<stoopkid> you see this in every bit of haskell code, for example:
09/19 03:17:35<stoopkid> f : Nat -> Nat
09/19 03:17:46<stoopkid> f x = S x
09/19 03:41:56<stoopkid> ok so, plug-in system
09/19 03:42:57<stoopkid> this could be as simple as just allowing the user to add shell commands that would run the 3rd party tools
09/19 03:48:34<stoopkid> we can already run those 3rd party tools like that anyway, and all this is doing is making a way to consolidate all your languages and their tools into one place to integrate their usage

09/19 20:31:10<editable-koo>what does vim have beyond syntax highlighting regexes?
09/19 20:32:13<stoopkid> aside from the ability to run shell commands, that's about it
09/19 20:47:29<sirdancealot> <stoopkid> wrt database, we don't want to have to recompile all the knowledge enco
              <sirdancealot> ded in MLTT every time we add/change some information
09/19 20:47:34<sirdancealot> i have no idea what youre talking about
09/19 20:50:11<stoopkid> let's say you have a C++ program
09/19 20:50:15<stoopkid> and you change something
09/19 20:50:19<stoopkid> you have to recompile it
09/19 20:50:44<stoopkid> beyond that you'll have to be more specific about what exactly you're not understanding
09/19 20:50:47<sirdancealot> ah so you were comparing mltt in a db vs mltt in files
09/19 20:50:54<stoopkid> right
09/19 20:51:14<sirdancealot> you keep getting me confused on a lot of fronts
09/19 20:51:25<sirdancealot> like the "vocabulary" thing you keep mentioning
09/19 20:52:31<sirdancealot> i really cant imagine how a mltt-based db would be used for some things that i know how a triplestore can be used for
09/19 20:52:34<sirdancealot> but
09/19 20:53:12<sirdancealot> if youre still into it, how about we make a little prototype in python
09/19 20:53:54<stoopkid> an mltt-db prototype?
09/19 20:54:19<sirdancealot> yeah
09/19 20:54:29<stoopkid> sure
09/19 20:56:34<stoopkid> so, wrt mltt vs. triple-store, surely you can imagine how an n3-based db could be used for everything that a triplestore or quadstore could be used for, and then literally infinitely more right?
09/19 20:58:20<sirdancealot> no, in my mind a n3-based db = triplestore
09/19 20:58:27<stoopkid> ah
09/19 20:59:34<stoopkid> well, then this mltt-db is essentially an n3-db but with mltt built-ins
09/19 21:00:14<sirdancealot> hrmpf
09/19 21:03:01<stoopkid> hehe ok we should probably go through the whole thing from the beginning and make sure we're on the same page just at least wrt terminology
09/19 21:04:15<editable-koo>hehe
09/19 21:04:29<editable-koo>i think id rather code now tho
09/19 21:05:55<stoopkid> the mltt/n3-db?
09/19 21:06:27<sirdancealot> no i want to improve the menu system in newshit a bit
09/19 21:06:50<stoopkid> ah, ok cool cause i was gonna say i'm not quite ready to jump into that db yet
09/19 21:06:59<sirdancealot> cool
09/19 21:11:19<sirdancealot> i had a curious day at work
09/19 21:11:50<sirdancealot> first i got to know folks in the warehouse and my namesake nextdoor
09/19 21:13:20<sirdancealot> and then i got a presentation on a system of tram depot control that 3 folks down the hallway work on
09/19 21:13:33<sirdancealot> the thing is, what we work on is also a system of tram depot control
09/19 21:14:20<sirdancealot> apperently some politics and lack of communication or will here and there made the company go schizo
09/19 21:14:40<sirdancealot> their system is like 10x more advanced and polished than ours
09/19 21:16:04<stoopkid> curious indeed. so would the current managers have your team working on a less advanced/polished version of what the other team is working on?
09/19 21:16:08<stoopkid> so why would*
09/19 21:16:39<sirdancealot> a problem with it apparently is that they cant get safety certifications for it, because the control is centralized in a complex server, while our system is based on PLCs doing all the core work
09/19 21:17:17<stoopkid> i see
09/19 21:18:26<stoopkid> so your PLC-based system is eventually supposed to live up to the precedents set by the other server-controlled system?
09/19 21:18:39<stoopkid> but meeting all the safety certifications
09/19 21:19:15<sirdancealot> yeah thats kinda the vision i think, its supposed to run without a human operator like the other one
09/19 21:21:37<stoopkid> makes a decent amount of sense. i'm familiar with the safety certifications thing with PLCs, that was a big reason that we didn't have much option to use anything more sophisticated or appropriate for the tasks at my last job; it would've been a lot harder to get all the safety certifications with anything besides a PLC which was already certified that it at
              <stoopkid> least wouldn't fail at the hardware/firmware level

09/19 22:00:04<sirdancealot> emacs is having memory leaks
09/19 22:02:01<stoopkid> i do wanna take a look at the scala stuff but i'm still working myself up to a point where i'd be ready to jump into it
09/19 22:02:49<stoopkid> i don't have a complete picture of how it would look either, i've just got some parts worked out and it seems a good guideline to follow
09/19 22:10:37<stoopkid> at the most basic level it'd just be like any MLTT system (agda, coq, etc..) except geared to handle CRUD operations and queries rather than just geared to be a "program that 'runs'"
09/19 22:11:39<stoopkid> your data being stored in that system doesn't necessarily "look" much different than it would in, say, a relational db, or regular triple-store, or an n3-db, or w/e
09/19 22:12:30<stoopkid> but your typing & query systems would have the full power of MLTT, for whenever you feel like you need this full power
09/19 22:13:52<stoopkid> you'd query against the kb, just like in n3, except you'd have the built-in MLTT functionality
09/19 22:14:33<stoopkid> and MLTT's auto-proving functionality would just be a form of query
09/19 22:15:31<sirdancealot> yeah i kinda get the idea
09/19 22:15:43<sirdancealot> so, class MlttNode?
09/19 22:18:51<stoopkid> hrm, i don't have a totally clear picture of how the MLTT would relate back to lemon nodes, but probably?
09/19 22:19:06<sirdancealot> not meant to be lemon related
09/19 22:21:32<sirdancealot> and in its simplest form, a database would be just an array of those
09/19 22:21:38<sirdancealot> or a map?
09/19 22:22:06<stoopkid> hrm, so what would be held in an MlttNode?
09/19 22:22:19<sirdancealot> it would be a superclass
09/19 22:23:51<stoopkid> what would be its subclasses though and what would they contain
09/19 22:25:10<sirdancealot> well i supose it would be the same hiearachy we have in lemon mltt?
09/19 22:25:20<sirdancealot> to, function type, literal..
09/19 22:26:47<stoopkid> ah, so this would be the superclass of MLTT expressions, and then a database would be an array of MLTT expressions?
09/19 22:26:56<sirdancealot> yeah?
09/19 22:28:43<stoopkid> i see. i've got one adjustment to that: it would be a map of MLTT types to arrays of stored proofs
09/19 22:30:14<sirdancealot> ic
09/19 22:30:21<sirdancealot> so its your proof db
09/19 22:31:06<stoopkid> more or less. essentially any "mltt-db" would be
09/19 22:32:31<stoopkid> but just about any kind of db can be viewed as a "proof db" for some logical system (which is generally not as powerful as MLTT), and queries against them can be viewed as some limited version of autoproving
09/19 22:34:29<stoopkid> like, let's take SQL for example. you've got some built-in base types like INT, STRING, DATETIME, etc.. and then you can form record types from these, which become the "types" of the records stored in tables that use those record types
09/19 22:34:49<stoopkid> the records are essentially proofs of the types
09/19 22:35:22<stoopkid> and then you can make SQL queries, which incorporate more logic. if we phrased these SQL queries in terms of MLTT, then the queries would be complex types, using logical operators
09/19 22:35:36<stoopkid> and the query process would be equivalent to the auto-proving process
09/19 22:35:57<stoopkid> existing records in the database are assumptions that the auto-proving process can use to form proofs (i.e. query results)

09/19 22:40:08<stoopkid> so, it's not exactly the proof-db, but both this and the proof-db would be based on an MLTT-db
09/19 22:40:42<stoopkid> now, if we didn't have the goal of supporting some reasonably sophisticated CNL for voice-control, then i wouldn't be opting to use an MLTT-db
09/19 22:41:26<editable-koo>hmm
09/19 22:43:17<stoopkid> and the main reason i'm opting to use an MLTT-db to handle the CNL for voice-control is because i think this is by far the most straight-forward and well-developed method available today for having a machine handle the logical statements that can't be avoided for any reasonable CNL
09/19 22:43:40<stoopkid> err, s/MLTT-db/MLTT at all/
09/19 22:45:15<stoopkid> we could get this same capacity with just an n3-db (maybe with some extra built-ins, not sure), but then you'd have to write all this basic logic yourself in MLTT and make sure that everything can be reasoned over coherently using w/e rules you write
09/19 22:47:33<stoopkid> err
09/19 22:47:44<stoopkid> you'd have to write all the basic logic in n3*
09/19 22:48:06<stoopkid> (the basic logic for reasoning over the logical statements that get expressed in CNL)
09/19 22:48:24<editable-koo>not sure why youd have to write logic in n3
09/19 22:49:52<stoopkid> well, lemme rephrase, *somewhere* you'd have to write logic that interprets & reasons over the CNL expressions
09/19 22:50:36<editable-koo>well, ill be curious to see some exmaples of stuff expressed in mltt
09/19 22:51:00<editable-koo>and i dont mean Nat and clusters of sets
09/19 22:52:30<stoopkid> what do you wanna see?
09/19 22:52:33<editable-koo>right now im considering biting the bullet and starting using rdfalchemy in newshit for a simple usecase

09/19 22:53:21<editable-koo>to store the currently displayed menu in it
09/19 22:54:43<editable-koo>not sure of the format even in n3 hehe
09/19 22:55:41<stoopkid> so you'd have a type of menus, and then an MLTT expression stating that "currentDisplayedMenu : Menu", and then you'd have "currentDisplayedMenu = <your current menu>", and then when your program is trying to figure out what menu to use, it queries the db for the value of currentDisplayedMenu
09/19 22:56:18<stoopkid> as one possibility
09/19 22:56:54<editable-koo>in python, its a list of items where each item has a dict with various components of a final sorting score, like {'textual match': 10, 'full parse':10, 'type match':10, 'in scope':10}
09/19 22:57:39<stoopkid> so then the type "Menu" would reflect that
09/19 22:58:18<stoopkid> or if you want to avoid having to come up with a type for it, then "Menu" can essentially just stand for a text type, and you just store plain-text configurations or JSON or w/e
09/19 22:59:07<editable-koo>that would work he he
09/19 22:59:22<stoopkid> you don't necessarily get to reason about your Menus to quite the same extent if you do that, but if you do that then it kinda suggests that you aren't trying to employ this more sophisticated reasoning over them anyway

09/19 23:01:42<editable-koo>rdf is so brainbending
09/19 23:02:08<stoopkid> heh, yea i'm not a fan
09/19 23:02:33<stoopkid> i'm amazed at how much ad-hocness they managed to add to something as simple as triples...
09/19 23:02:58<editable-koo>yea well thats kinda the beauty, like lisp
09/19 23:05:11<stoopkid> im not sure how that's the beauty, heh; it's exactly the brain-bendingness to me
09/19 23:10:30<editable-koo>for what i want to accomplish with the menu, the tripleness isnt actually needed
09/19 23:10:35<editable-koo>or the linkedness
09/19 23:11:45<editable-koo>it would suffice that id use a nosql, the key is that its a db thats a different process than my program, and that the data i store in there keep some self-descriptiveness
09/19 23:12:16<editable-koo>json, like you said

09/19 23:12:56<editable-koo>but if its one json blob you lose the ability to query for individual menu items or whatever
09/19 23:13:18<editable-koo>not without writing javascript
09/19 23:14:54<stoopkid> sure, yea nothing about this menu example motivates either a triple-store or an MLTT-db
09/19 23:15:24<stoopkid> tbh i'm not even sure it really motivates a nosql db cause the amount of data being stored there would be pretty small and there's definitely python libs for parsing json
09/19 23:15:49<editable-koo>its not about parsing json
09/19 23:16:02<editable-koo>its about making this data first-class
09/19 23:17:17<editable-koo>and, i think it would be cozy if i had them in a triplestore and could write a simple rule that would sum up their component scores and could use a query sorting and filtering them by it
09/19 23:17:27<stoopkid> there's no python libs for json to build it up into an object such that you can access it's members in a first-class way?
09/19 23:17:57<editable-koo>the angle im taking here is: if its in python, its not first-class
09/19 23:18:28<stoopkid> hrm, then i'm not sure what you mean by first-class here
09/19 23:18:43<editable-koo>the python interpreter doesnt make a good db
09/19 23:21:50<stoopkid> hrm yea i guess without a db system we'd have to write all the query/sort/filter functionality ourselves and it wouldn't be as optimal or vetted as it would be in a real db

              <editable-koo>you mean for the menu or for mltt db?
09/19 23:27:49<stoopkid> i mean for the menu, but yea for the mltt db we'd need some kind of db system unless we wanted to roll the whole thing ourselves
09/19 23:29:33<stoopkid> pretty much any kind of db would work, we'd just add extra MLTT logic "around" the database: i.e. type-checking things before we store them, making the auto-proving process work with db queries, etc..
09/19 23:30:01<editable-koo>yeah..
09/19 23:30:50<editable-koo>and we might get some advanced stuff like replication and transactions for free
09/19 23:30:55<editable-koo>almost free
09/19 23:31:13<stoopkid> hrm, can you elaborate?
09/19 23:31:28<editable-koo>on?
09/19 23:31:58<stoopkid> where we'd be getting this advanced stuff out of this
09/19 23:32:19<editable-koo>where?
09/19 23:32:59<editable-koo>if we build the mltt-db on top of some conventional db system
09/19 23:34:12<stoopkid> i mean how does that lead to replication and transactions "almost for free"
09/19 23:35:04<stoopkid> it sounds right, i'm just having a brain malfunction or something; not seeing the link here
09/19 23:35:44<editable-koo>well if we use for example mysql to store our mltt stuff, then we'll have some add() function that does the typechecking and then calls INSERT
09/19 23:36:10<editable-koo>and we'll have a commit function that calls mysql commit
09/19 23:36:42<editable-koo>so, we have our data transactioned
09/19 23:37:12<stoopkid> ah, right, i see
09/19 23:37:20<stoopkid> yea exactly
09/19 23:40:28<stoopkid> we'd maybe still want to open up the transaction system to the user, but yea the MLTT would be handling a big set of transactions automatically/for-free, and ideally the user wouldn't need transaction-control beyond this
09/19 23:40:41<stoopkid> haven't thought it through to that point yet though
09/19 23:40:51<stoopkid> wouldn't need much**
09/19 23:45:15<editable-koo>doesnt make sense to me
09/19 23:45:23<editable-koo>its the user who needs transactions in the first place
09/19 23:45:54<stoopkid> and the MLTT subsystem is essentially such a user
09/19 23:45:55<editable-koo>if the mltt layer ends up doing multiple modifications per one user-modification, then it needs transactions as well
09/19 23:46:14<editable-koo>or needs to be covered under user's transactions
09/19 23:47:43<editable-koo>a simple example where transactions are useful is a cms system where when you are deleting a user, you want to delete all his posts too
09/19 23:48:13<editable-koo>transactions protect your other code from seeing the db in a state where there are posts that belong to an invalid user
09/19 23:48:48<stoopkid> sure
09/19 23:48:53<editable-koo>i guess you think you can handle that on the mltt typesystem level?
09/19 23:49:55<stoopkid> we could but i don't know if we need to or even should necessarily
09/19 23:50:49<stoopkid> the mltt would automate those transactions that it uses, which would overlap somewhat with the transactions that a user would normally have to write themselves, that's all i meant
09/19 23:52:19<stoopkid> and i think there's ways we could allow the user to take advantage of the MLTT to automate more transactions, but.. that's getting ahead of ourselves
09/19 23:53:26<stoopkid> for example, in your delete a user & their posts example, if the fact that posts "belong" to a user can be indicated, then the MLTT can potentially delete everything that belongs to an object when it deletes that object

09/19 23:54:39<stoopkid> is there any advantage to doing this within MLTT rather than a separate transaction system? i can't really see any, just throwing out possibilities
09/19 23:56:32<stoopkid> the benefits to an MLTT-db relative to existing databases would be that you can store a much much wider variety of objects and validate that they're objects of a particular MLTT datatype
09/19 23:56:50<stoopkid> so, for example there's no SQL column type for "functions", let alone "functions that satisfy such and such properties"
09/19 23:57:27<stoopkid> and then you have a much more powerful & generalized query system over your db, using the auto-proving process
09/19 23:58:12<stoopkid> so, any example that would motivate an MLTT-db would include either a) more complex objects that need to be stored and verified, and b) more complex queries that need to be supported
09/19 23:59:29<stoopkid> CNL provides an endless supply of these examples, as does anything where we're talking about a database for code or a database requiring complex reasoning

09/22 19:24:00<editable-koo>as on the high level lang...im thinking in terms of a language for describing pieces of a program
09/22 19:24:07<editable-koo>"nodes are a class hierarchy"
09/22 19:24:54<editable-koo>now, palette() is a function in nodes
09/22 19:25:19<editable-koo>i want a special projection for it, like a table
09/22 19:25:29<editable-koo>with a column for class and a column for some code
09/22 19:32:22<stoopkid> what's this palette() function do?
09/22 19:36:45<stoopkid> "i gotta say...even this 20 hours/week engagement is probably taking away my energy for coding other things", eh, even 20 hours/week is a decent amount especially since with this kind of work since i'm sure you spend more than 20 hours/week thinking about it
09/22 19:37:22<stoopkid> s/<one of the "since"s>//
09/22 19:40:45<editable-koo>palette() returns items that should be added to the menu
09/22 19:41:43<stoopkid> so the table would be like <menu item, class, code-for-menu-item-to-run> ?
09/22 19:42:24<editable-koo>just class, code
09/22 19:43:44<stoopkid> so, what are the classes going into the table and what's is the code that's being associated to them?
09/22 19:44:59<editable-koo>thats irrelevant for discussion of the higher level language
09/22 19:46:07<stoopkid> so what's the relevant part then
09/22 19:46:40<editable-koo>just the fact that i want a language to talk about a fragment of code
09/22 19:50:02<stoopkid> but like, what kind of fragments of code & what kind of things do you want to be able to express about them in the higher-level lang?
09/22 19:52:15<editable-koo>lets say you have a hierarchy of classess and each class overrides this one function
09/22 19:53:37<editable-koo>so, its a matter of projection if you look at it like:
09/22 19:53:41<editable-koo>class A:
09/22 19:53:46<editable-koo>def palette()...
09/22 19:53:48<editable-koo>class B:
09/22 19:53:53<editable-koo>def palette()..
09/22 19:53:57<editable-koo>or:
09/22 19:54:00<editable-koo>class A:...
09/22 19:54:04<editable-koo>class B:...
09/22 19:54:11<editable-koo>def palett(): 
09/22 19:54:17<editable-koo>if isinstance(s, A):...
09/22 19:54:22<editable-koo>elif isinstance(s, B
09/22 19:54:25<editable-koo>):..
09/22 19:55:38<stoopkid> ah so you'd have a table listing out your classes that descend from Node, and the code associated to each class would be that class's version of palette() ?
09/22 19:55:53<editable-koo>yeah
09/22 19:56:34<editable-koo>im actually in the process of rewriting this function in newshit into the second form
09/22 19:56:49<editable-koo>because its a mess
09/22 19:57:02<editable-koo>but at different times different projections are bett
09/22 19:57:03<editable-koo>er
09/22 20:00:19<stoopkid> hrm, so the first form is projecting them as if each class has as a member it's own special version of palette() and in the second form you're projecting them as if all the classes are using some kind of "universal" palette() function that differentiates based on the class that's calling it?
09/22 20:00:42<editable-koo>so i suppose i first want a language to speak about the language
09/22 20:00:43<editable-koo>yes
09/22 20:01:12<stoopkid> i like that (being able to project it into different but equivalent forms)
09/22 20:03:20<editable-koo>everybody will
09/22 20:06:17<stoopkid> so would the code here be python or code written in languages built in lemon?
09/22 20:06:41<editable-koo>dunno
09/22 20:11:42<stoopkid> i'm thinking restricting it to just python would make sense at the beginning, since i think there would be a lot of details to work out to get code written in languages built in lemon to operate "seamlessly" with the python
09/22 20:12:15<editable-koo>what do you mean operate with python?
09/22 20:13:29<stoopkid> like, if you build a language in lemon and then write some code in it, your code wouldn't necessarily have access to any of the objects & functions in the rest of the python code-base
09/22 20:14:20<stoopkid> like if i had "if isinstance(s,A): <some MLTT code>", our MLTT language can't, for example, access "s" or "A" and do things with them
09/22 20:15:25<editable-koo>ah
09/22 20:16:51<stoopkid> but then again, nobody ever said that code written in MLTT necessarily needs to access anything like that
09/22 20:17:15<editable-koo>yea
09/22 20:17:41<stoopkid> so, maybe it makes sense to allow both and if the code is written in a language built in lemon then there may or may not be some limitations compared to using the python, but the python is always there as a fall-back if you need it
09/22 20:20:03<editable-koo>yea well i have no idea about any of that yet
09/22 20:22:27<stoopkid> two options that both seem sensible to me would be to either restrict it to just python at the beginning and just have <class, code>, or allow either python or any language you've built in lemon and extend the projection to <class,language,code>
09/22 20:24:00<stoopkid> but, either way this seems like a relatively straight-forward feature to add
09/22 20:25:21<stoopkid> if the lang is python you just eval() the code, and if the lang was built in lemon then you'd use the standard method for executing code written in that lang
09/22 20:29:49<stoopkid> now, how are you planning to handle code highlighting? seems to me the code-highlighting for a lang should be separate from the lang definition itself so that you can potentially have multiple highlighting schemes for the same lang
09/22 20:31:51<editable-koo>syntactic highlighting is bs anyway
09/22 20:32:19<editable-koo>if youre into it, we'll find a way to plug it in
09/22 20:32:48<stoopkid> what do you imagine instead? semantic highlighting?
09/22 20:34:36<editable-koo>yea seems more useful
09/22 20:35:22<editable-koo>usual syntactic highlighting doesnt even seem applicable to lemon lang
09/22 20:35:53<stoopkid> well, i do like the sound of that
09/22 20:36:18<stoopkid> are there any semantic highlighting systems already? can't say i'm familiar with anything of the sort
09/22 20:37:56<editable-koo>systems?
09/22 20:39:16<stoopkid> tools, frameworks, packages, libs... something already built that provides an approximation of what you have in mind
09/22 20:40:37<editable-koo>probably a couple
09/22 20:41:37<stoopkid> i guess any editor that has semantic error highlighting is a simple example
09/22 20:46:30<editable-koo>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12552623
09/22 21:28:41<stoopkid> i wonder how many viruses my dad must have to make our internet so slow
09/22 21:29:16<stoopkid> i need to get a packet analyzer and figure out wtf is going on
09/22 21:30:11<stoopkid> i'm trying to clone a package from github and it's averaging about 15 KiB/s
09/22 21:31:18<stoopkid> like, i'm pretty patient with a slow internet connection but this is getting pretty ridiculous





09/23 00:17:35<stoopkid> i hate emacs
09/23 00:28:05<stoopkid> i should rephrase: i dislike it when using an emacs mode requires installation of a bunch of other modes and a bunch of configurations as if emacs were an operating system...
09/23 00:28:43<stoopkid> like, if i wanted an OS, i'd use linux, oh wait, i already was
09/23 00:31:12<stoopkid> and when i install a package on linux, it does the sensible thing which is to install all the dependencies and automatically handle the configurations...
09/23 00:32:40<stoopkid> plus i'm not like an emacs pro or anything so this whole process is extremely confusing..
09/23 00:33:36<stoopkid> and to add insult to injury, my 15 KiB/s internet connection is making it take forever to find instructions online
09/23 00:50:18<stoopkid> my new goal: build lemon into a sensible replacement for vim and emacs
09/23 00:52:49<stoopkid> oy
09/23 00:52:57<stoopkid> and then when you find their instructions, they don't even work
09/23 00:53:17<stoopkid> "Then press C-M-x with point somewhere in this form to install and enable Flycheck for the current Emacs session."
http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/
09/23 00:53:21* stoopkid presses C-M-x
09/23 00:53:30<stoopkid> "C-M-x is undefined"
09/23 01:43:54<stoopkid> and finally i manage to get it installed
09/23 01:44:03<stoopkid> and now that it's installed, it doesn't work
09/23 01:44:04<stoopkid> great
09/23 01:45:51<stoopkid> like, there should never be this much trouble to install something unless you're actually doing a serious amount of customization and not just trying to use *the only editor that exists for a language*
09/23 05:02:28<stoopkid> so, after looking at some systems for syntactic highlighting, i think i'm getting a clearer picture of how to handle semantic highlighting
09/23 05:03:11<stoopkid> for example, vim has syntax files to describe the syntax & its highlighting for a lang
09/23 05:03:46<stoopkid> you can name/group keywords and syntactic structures and assign highlighting information to them
09/23 05:04:50<stoopkid> for semantic highlighting, i'm thinking it would essentially be the exact same idea except you'd do this for the structures that can appear in your ASTs
09/23 05:06:16<stoopkid> so, in lemon's case, that would be the node classes that we define
09/23 05:06:54<stoopkid> in mltt's case that'd be Var, ParExp, PiType, etc..
09/23 05:07:26<stoopkid> so you could just define highlighting information directly in these classes
09/23 05:07:47<stoopkid> you're probably thinking "yea obviously"
09/23 05:08:39<stoopkid> took me a bit to work out how that transition from syntactic to semantic would actually look under the surface tho
09/23 05:09:35<stoopkid> now, after thinking a bit deeper into it, i think syntactic highlighting is still necessary
09/23 05:10:23<stoopkid> let's say i try to write out a pi-type or a lambda expression, and i mess something up so there's a syntax error
09/23 05:10:36<stoopkid> since there's a syntax error, it doesn't parse
09/23 05:10:49<stoopkid> since it doesn't parse, it never becomes associated to a semantic value
09/23 05:11:33<stoopkid> since it never becomes associated to a semantic value, it wouldn't get any highlighting (if all the highlighting was defined in the node classes)
09/23 05:12:48<stoopkid> i'd think that if you make a syntax error that prevents the expression from being parsed into a semantic value, that syntactic highlighting should be employed as a fall-back
09/23 05:15:02<stoopkid> so, the way i'm imagining that is that essentially there would be a standard syntactic highlighting system, but for any given expression, if that expression can be successfully parsed into a semantic value, then the semantic highlighting would override the syntactic highlighting
09/23 05:16:05<stoopkid> that seems good to me except for a (relatively minor) issue that the syntactic highlighting and semantic highlighting probably shouldn't "clash" with each other
09/23 05:16:28<stoopkid> like, let's say my syntactic highlighting takes the keyword "Pi" and makes it blue and bold
09/23 05:16:55<stoopkid> but then let's say that the semantic highlighting defined in the PiType class makes the "Pi" be yellow and italic
09/23 05:17:48<stoopkid> ideally there could be some mechanism that could allow the user to ensure that their syntactic and semantic highlighting schemes "agree" everywhere that they overlap
09/23 05:18:58<stoopkid> but, like i said, imo that's a relatively minor issue since it can be solved by the user simply being careful, and there may be cases where the user doesn't necessarily want their syntactic & semantic highlighting schemes to agree everywhere
09/23 05:20:25<stoopkid> one situation might be if the programmer wants visual indication of which expressions have successfully parsed and which haven't, but actually wants some kind of highlighting on the expressions that don't parse (as opposed to just having it default to unhighlighted text)
09/23 05:20:54<stoopkid> another issue, which isn't quite so minor:
09/23 05:21:50<stoopkid> in pretty much any IDE, there will be error highlighting
09/23 05:23:14<stoopkid> there's syntactic error highlighting, which is pretty straightforward; if the expression doesn't parse then underline it in red (or however the user wants to highlight that)
09/23 05:23:34<stoopkid> that can be defined with the rest of the syntactic highlighting
09/23 05:23:43<stoopkid> semantic error highlighting is a bit trickier
09/23 05:24:10<stoopkid> especially if we went with this method of sticking the semantic highlighting info in the node classes
09/23 05:25:06<stoopkid> so, you probably see what the issue here is now: take our MLTT implementation for example, all the node classes there are only defining types of expressions that *successfully* parse
09/23 05:26:18<stoopkid> so, that system needs to be extended with ways to talk about various kinds of semantic errors, and assign different kinds of highlighting to them
09/23 05:27:01<stoopkid> at the moment i don't see any other serious issues
09/23 05:27:36<stoopkid> and both of these seem solvable (though i can't say i have any clear ideas of what the specific solutions would be)
09/23 05:29:04<stoopkid> maybe you could go over with me what you've worked on in regards to talking about semantic errors within lemon (if you've done anything to that end yet)
09/23 05:31:40<stoopkid> lol, it's kind of funny that each of us has a channel we could be using and you've specifically got the lemon dev channel, and yet recently we've only been talking about lemon dev in jmv's eulerGUI channel
09/23 05:32:31<stoopkid> we need to come up with a name for the new tau already so that we can move lemon dev back into the lemon channel lol

09/23 10:07:39<editable-koo>this channel/topic intermixing is good i think
09/23 10:07:57<editable-koo>as on semantic highlighting, i havent thought about it much
09/23 10:08:29<editable-koo>in newshit there is a system of arrows, if you use some identifier somewhere it draws an arrow pointing to its definition
09/23 10:09:04<editable-koo>as on "highlighting", i like the idea that we would color each variable within a function a little differently
09/23 10:09:50<editable-koo>id suggest to think out of the box of coloring text and more about drawing additional info around the text
09/23 10:10:14<editable-koo>and yea what you say makes sense, syntax highilighting/feedback is necessary
09/23 10:10:55<editable-koo>but none of this seems like a key component, so..
09/23 10:11:31<editable-koo>dude, today on the train i was listening to two guys chat, one working in netflix or somesuch, pushing online tv into africa
09/23 10:12:01<editable-koo>the other has some kind of app development framework and now theyre making a simplified version that could be marketed as a kind of end user programming
09/23 10:12:09<editable-koo>i should have talked to him
09/23 10:12:49<editable-koo>here i am with my day job making these kind of shitty apps instead of making a framework for users to make them themselves
09/23 10:14:12<editable-koo>but i dont think the problem is purely technological, i could push this app out in 14 days if el chefe didnt know only one way to build this kind of apps and for some mysterious reason i didnt have to build it perfectly scalable 
09/23 10:14:34<editable-koo>dude's a dumbass
09/23 10:20:58<editable-koo>at least i think im gonna use exactly this for the new gui

09/28 19:08:41<stoopkid> not a bad idea

09/28 19:15:06<stoopkid> i'm having trouble figuring out what it is she wants me to "do"
09/28 19:15:59<stoopkid> all she sent me was some mockups that it looks like she maybe put together in photoshop or something
09/28 19:17:17<stoopkid> well, she sent me their current page too i guess she wants me to rework their page into something that looks like the mockup
09/28 19:17:49* stoopkid doesn't know how this page is being generated but let's see if i can find out
09/28 19:18:38<stoopkid> i'm totally gonna call her and ask for clarification but let's see if i can answer all the stupid questions before i do that
09/28 19:25:45<stoopkid> hrm

09/28 20:23:13<editable-koo>they have it running on some web hosting or something?
09/28 20:24:08<editable-koo>btw, ive been playing with redmine, or rather, redmine is what i use in work a little, just looking up uploaded files really, but ive been playing with easyredmine.com
09/28 20:24:26<editable-koo>its redmine with some plugins or something
09/28 20:24:45<stoopkid> i have no idea all i got was some photoshop documents that look exactly like what it already is except on a couple of them "Blog" is added to the header
09/28 20:24:53<editable-koo>its quite a complete thingy, you got time tracking, tasks and priorities and file management and stuff
09/28 20:25:18<editable-koo>well, time to call i guess
09/28 20:29:15<stoopkid> yea i just e-mailed her like an hour ago saying i'd check it out so i'll just call her tomorrow, apparently time isn't a huge concern anyway it took her two weeks to send me some  photoshop docs that are already what it is
09/28 20:31:19<stoopkid> people are funny
09/28 20:31:59<editable-koo>im glad i dont have to deal with this kind of shit now
09/28 20:32:16<editable-koo>have different kind of shit instead
09/28 20:32:21<stoopkid> anyway, this job's looking like it's gonna be a piece of cake on the technical end, looks like the majority of the work is gonna be me just figuring out wtf she actually wants me to do lol
09/28 20:32:49<stoopkid> heh yea i'm just not gonna worry about, kinda means i don't have to do all that much
09/28 20:33:23<stoopkid> im definitely not feeling a lot of pressure lol
09/28 20:37:44<stoopkid> so, if i can get like $500 a month out of this that'd probably cover my bills & rent to my parents and i can chill for a while
09/28 20:39:35<editable-koo>you think you can?
09/28 20:44:57*** Quit: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@236.152.broadband3.iol.cz) left #eulergui: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
09/28 20:45:20<stoopkid> idk it's not setting the expectations very high though, if she can't generate $500 worth of web dev work for me a month i'll be really confused as to how she's maintaining her own lifestyle
09/28 20:45:33<stoopkid> and i can definitely take on way more than.... whatever the hell this is lol
09/28 20:48:41<stoopkid> well, i gather she wants me to make a mock-site based on the current site and her photo-shops, and that shouldn't be hard, so maybe i'll just set up a mock site and a couple different versions of what i think she means and let her pick or refine her specifications
09/28 20:49:22<stoopkid> the site looks like it's pretty much all browser-side, so shouldn't have trouble there
09/28 20:56:04<stoopkid> a couple of the things break if you just save the page and reopen it, i guess i'll have to fix those up
09/28 20:56:24*** Join: sirdancealot (~sirdancea@109.107.211.244, (unauthenticated): realname)
09/28 20:58:34<stoopkid> that's not a bad design pattern for websites actually. shouldn't matter where you open the browser-side tool from
09/28 21:00:26<stoopkid> let's you hire front-end devs without exposing the back-end and makes it easier for everybody on the front-end
09/28 21:01:30<stoopkid> also lets you satisfy the basic intuition that if you save a file and then reopen it you should get the same thing
09/28 21:02:41<stoopkid> i guess that pattern only really works on a site that's not very interactive
09/28 21:08:32<stoopkid> heh, from a pragmatic perspective if i just fix these issues then i have my mock-up in hand lol
09/28 21:09:50<stoopkid> this site is particularly not very interactive and the things that do break when you save and reopen it are definitely things that there's no reason this should happen, like the backgrounds
09/28 21:18:25<stoopkid> only 3 things seem to break if you just save & reopen, let's see if i can fix those and then i've got a mock site
09/28 21:21:24<editable-koo>you mean save locally as a html file?
09/28 21:25:06<stoopkid> right
09/28 21:43:59<stoopkid> seems like the easiest way to go about this and actually come back with a completely working thing from these minimal specifications along with options rather than just questions
09/28 21:44:23<editable-koo>dunno
09/28 21:44:29<editable-koo>hope its gonna work for you
09/28 21:45:10<stoopkid> heh, no idea
09/28 21:51:22<stoopkid> i should probably curl it rather than save it from the browser
09/28 21:51:58<editable-koo>well, the goal is that users can save the page?
09/28 21:52:17<stoopkid> no the goal's a mockup of the site
09/28 21:52:39<editable-koo>ah
09/28 21:53:19<editable-koo>might be good to get access to the server
09/28 22:02:36<stoopkid> probably, normally i'd just be asking that already but i'm confused by the fact that the images describing the mockup i'm supposed to be making look exactly like the page that's already there, and the easiest way i could get a "mock up", which has been left completely undefined but as best i can gather/guess it's something you can have locally that
09/28 22:02:37<stoopkid> implements the front-end functionality without needing the back-end to deliver it to you, is just to save the html page and make it work when you start it locally
09/28 22:04:23<stoopkid> and since that would only take me like an hour and i need to get familiar with this anyway i might as well i guess, and then idk how it could be more "mock" besides just removing functionality
09/28 22:08:38<editable-koo>hmm
09/28 22:11:47<stoopkid> and when i say exactly i mean it literally just is the page, there's only two discernible differences i can tell in any of the 6 images she sent me from the pages they correspond to
09/28 22:12:44<stoopkid> and they're so minor that i can't tell if they're accidental, because the 6 images are only of 3 of the pages, so some of the versions of page have the change and others don't, and there are other things that are obviously just mistakes like a random margin on one of the images
09/28 22:13:17<stoopkid> or a "continue reading" button on an image that already had a "learn more" button
09/28 22:13:18<stoopkid> lol
09/28 22:48:38<editable-koo>i gotta try to sleep

09/30 01:13:17<stoopkid> so i heard back from her
09/30 01:13:49<stoopkid> she said that my approach would make sense, but that she was just giving me an exercise to see if i can build up the site from scratch
09/30 01:16:18<stoopkid> but my approach even if i were building the site from scratch would be to totally just rip off the existing code
09/30 01:16:24* stoopkid shrugs
09/30 01:17:55<stoopkid> i have like a million more questions for her but i feel like i'm just supposed to go about it however i'd think to go about it and not hound her with questions

09/30 17:45:45<editable-koo>if i said lets finish tau now, would you have a plan?
09/30 17:52:25<stoopkid> not quite yet, but i'm getting closer
09/30 18:22:47<editable-koo>just curious:)
09/30 18:36:33<editable-koo>so, it may not sound too surprising, but one optimization i should do in my life is to bring my job and interests closer
09/30 18:36:45<editable-koo>iow, find a job related to lemon and stuff
09/30 18:36:59<editable-koo>or start monetizing on my interests
09/30 18:40:15<editable-koo>when i worked 6 hours/day, i couldnt find any time for lemon
09/30 18:41:15<editable-koo>now im working 4, i do at least find time to catch up with you and maybe read a java book or something, or try some scala or work on newshit once in a while
09/30 18:41:34<editable-koo>but thats all
09/30 18:43:14<editable-koo>also, im in a silly situation where im paying rent for a flat where i spend mostly just weekends
09/30 18:43:28<editable-koo>since its just easier to crash in my moms place on the way from work
09/30 18:43:49<editable-koo>and all my friends and stuff are here
09/30 18:44:29<editable-koo>i want to find a flat near my workplace, always wanted to live there regardless of the company
09/30 18:44:57<editable-koo>but it could become silly if i quit there before i even move into it
09/30 18:45:07<editable-koo>if i put things into motion now
09/30 18:54:17<stoopkid> yea would be nice to just get paid for the shit we actually work on somehow
09/30 18:54:52<sirdancealot> yea gotta start taking it seriously
09/30 18:55:03<sirdancealot> people run kickstarters on all kinds of crap
09/30 18:55:37<sirdancealot> and there are other options
09/30 18:56:58<stoopkid> hypothetically people are supposed to be able to make money from these block-chain things
09/30 18:57:04* stoopkid still hasn't figured it out yet
09/30 18:57:09<sirdancealot> hehe
09/30 18:58:06<sirdancealot> apparently you gotta start your own currency or something
09/30 18:58:50<stoopkid> do you wanna buy my fake money from the clouds?
09/30 18:59:17<stoopkid> gets 'em every time
09/30 18:59:36<stoopkid> practically sells itself
09/30 19:00:20<stoopkid> amazingly it actually would if we made tau
09/30 19:04:24<stoopkid> my plan with that is to figure out an abstract model of tau such that i can prove that it satisfies the required properties, and then figure out an implementation which is provably an instance of the abstract model
09/30 19:06:11<stoopkid> in the process i'm taking all the relevant results in theoretical comp sci and trying to formalize them into type theory
09/30 19:07:07<stoopkid> and provide more rigorous definitions for all these results so that they're interoperable in a cohesive fashion
09/30 19:07:58<stoopkid> once i have the abstract model and i can prove it satisfies the required properties (i.e. that it can construct a tau) then i'll translate that into implementation
09/30 19:08:13<stoopkid> some aspects of the implementation are required just by the form of the problem
09/30 19:09:19<stoopkid> and i'll try to find out exactly what aspects these are, and formalize that into a formal abstract protocol, such that the implementation implements it
09/30 19:10:11<stoopkid> and then.. that's tau
09/30 19:18:21<stoopkid> when i get the point that i have a provable abstract model of it, then i'll be ready to ask for money to build the thing
09/30 19:24:23<sirdancealot> sounds....reasonable, captain kirk

10/02 17:07:32<sirdancealot> yo
10/02 17:07:44<stoopkid> yo
10/02 17:21:23<stoopkid> i'm getting addicted to coq
10/02 17:22:27<stoopkid> but it's somewhat frustrating because it's very difficult to make your results interoperable
10/02 17:24:44<stoopkid> coq makes it like ridiculously easy to prove any particular basic theorem (where "basic" can actually get pretty sophisticated), but only if you've built up preliminary results in a form that's interoperable with the form in which you've expressed the proposition
10/02 17:26:24<stoopkid> you can always go back and rebuild your results in a way that *is* interoperable, but i find i'm often repeating myself just to shift the form of things slightly just to make them fit, even though none of the semantics or structure between the different forms really changes much
10/02 17:28:07<stoopkid> a lot of it has to do with IDE as well
10/02 17:32:44<stoopkid> just reaffirms my belief that these systems are like the machine code of logic, not the end-all-be-all of it
10/02 17:33:16<stoopkid> not even machine code, it's just the circuitry
10/02 17:33:39<stoopkid> tactics are more like the machine code
10/02 17:33:54<stoopkid> and we've yet to see any higher level logic languages
10/02 17:34:54<stoopkid> things like HoTT are just building better circuitry, still not a higher level logic language
10/02 17:36:10<stoopkid> here's an issue for example which demonstrates the "low-levelness" of it:
10/02 17:37:04<stoopkid> i'm doing this proof that requires me to show that (false = true) -> False
10/02 17:37:35<stoopkid> i've already proven that (true = false) -> False and that (A = B) -> (B = A)
10/02 17:39:27<stoopkid> so, i can finish the proof easily, but Coq doesn't help me find these other proofs i've already given, no semantic search capacity is exposed to the user really, even though it must have plenty under the surface
10/02 17:40:21<stoopkid> if you want interoperability, you've got to make many many many different proofs of different conversions
10/02 17:40:47<stoopkid> and since there's no semantic search/referencing capacity, you've got to come up with a bunch of names for these
10/02 17:40:58<stoopkid> and there's no good naming system; there just isn't
10/02 17:41:36<stoopkid> too much variety of too much complexity, and english just can't cut it
10/02 17:41:55<stoopkid> really string identifiers just can't cut it
10/02 17:42:58<stoopkid> but coq only gives syntactic referencing abilities, so we're screwed there, and we have to make as few as possible of the most general results that we can, otherwise it's just ridiculous
10/02 17:43:04<stoopkid> also, it should be a database
10/02 17:43:06<stoopkid> obviously
10/02 17:43:15<stoopkid> idk why they didn't make it a database to begin with
10/02 17:43:54<stoopkid> these automated theorem prover systems that aren't databases are just preposterous
10/02 17:45:18<stoopkid> content-addressable database solves the whole naming thing and exposes the semantic lookup to the user, which would seriously facilitate the interactive proving process
10/02 17:47:44<stoopkid> next problem: polymorphism
10/02 17:48:01<stoopkid> polymorphism is fantastic, but it sucks to actually have to write it and use it explicitly
10/02 17:48:10<stoopkid> coq is again no help here
10/02 17:48:32<stoopkid> my proof that converts (A = B) -> (B = A) is called Id_is_symmetric
10/02 17:48:52<stoopkid> it needs to take a bunch of arguments that give type information so that it can actually do the conversion
10/02 17:49:08<stoopkid> it's hard to remember what order this is supposed to go in or what it needs
10/02 17:52:26<stoopkid> ah, actually i can type in a line "Check Id_is_symmetric"
10/02 17:52:32<stoopkid> kinda clunky though
10/02 17:53:10<stoopkid> if i was on a command line i'd be like, sure, but this is a full-scale interactive theorem proving ide, i should probably just be able to hover/click it
10/02 20:25:36<editable-koo>:)
10/02 20:56:05<editable-koo>rdflib seems to work in python 3
10/02 21:04:31<editable-koo>i still seem to need to put my life more in order before i can focus on lemon
10/02 21:04:53<editable-koo>its the usual situation, it sucks because it seems so close to a major milestone
10/02 21:09:43<stoopkid> yea, i'm hoping to keep my life just in order enough to make it to the point where i can get something out of all this tau stuff
10/02 21:10:12<stoopkid> plan Bs can sometimes just interfere with plan As
10/02 21:10:26<stoopkid> get in the way of them *
10/02 21:14:09<stoopkid> i seem to be getting close to being on HMC's level with this theoretical comp sci shit
10/02 21:14:20<stoopkid> had a breakthrough the other day; not sure what happened
10/02 21:15:01<sirdancealot> maybe hmc had a breakdown
10/02 21:15:20<stoopkid> ah, that explains it
10/02 21:21:03<sirdancealot> what do you mean not sure what happened?
10/02 21:22:22<stoopkid> not sure why all the computability theory shit all of a sudden made sense
10/02 21:49:44<sirdancealot> we may never know
10/02 23:31:41<sirdancealot> i think i see the light too
10/02 23:31:46<sirdancealot> python 3 is dead
10/02 23:31:51<sirdancealot> im porting newshit back to 2
10/02 23:32:52<stoopkid> heh

10/09 21:24:24<stoopkid> hey no problem, did you get it figured out?
10/09 21:24:49<rszeno> no, they are a bunch of idiots
10/09 21:28:16<rszeno> hm, that means, you didn't get the money, actualy nobody get it
10/09 21:29:10<stoopkid> well hopefully it's still there somewhere
10/09 21:29:59<rszeno> who care if are useless for anybody
10/09 21:30:19<stoopkid> well, i meant somewhere such that you can access it :)
10/09 21:31:12<rszeno> how? i bet not even the idiots from paypay can't
10/09 21:31:28<rszeno> paypal i mean
10/09 21:32:31<stoopkid> if they lost it then keep hounding them for a refund until they give it to you, cause legally i'm sure they're supposed to be keeping some records of all that anyway
10/09 21:33:46<rszeno> i doubt they even know what this mean
10/09 21:35:02<rszeno> plus google is another shit this days
10/09 21:36:52<rszeno> doesn't matter, I will start a campain against paypal, to look as bad it is posible

10/10 22:44:07<stoopkid> he apparently couldn't get into his account, he was wondering if i changed the info
10/10 22:44:38<editable-koo>if you changed the credentials of his account?
10/10 22:44:43<stoopkid> yea
10/10 22:45:22<editable-koo>he gave them to you earlier?
10/10 22:45:42<stoopkid> yep
10/10 22:45:53<editable-koo>i see
10/10 22:46:14<stoopkid> and then he told me to change the credentials after i used the money in the account
10/10 22:46:26<editable-koo>i suppose you guys triggered their triggers

10/11 16:46:12<editable-koo>lets write an an command parser from scratch because using a library has more drawbacks
10/11 16:47:17<editable-koo>regexes would make things simpler but they are too hard, lets better have inferior error detection and nasty loops with lenghty ifs

10/11 16:50:39<editable-koo>instead of adding two buttons now that i finished and tested all the core code, the boss ends up starting a rewrite
10/11 16:52:39<editable-koo>then the guy sitting at the next table speaks up and says he wrote exactly this, just for a different modem brand, a year ago for another project

10/12 21:39:26-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, we will be carrying out some maintenance to a hidden hub at around 10PM UTC (~20 min from now). There will be brief disruption and a loss of services for the duration. You may wish to op yourself in any channels you manage. Apologies for the noise and thank you for your patience.

10/12 23:26:47-tomaw- [Global Notice] Looks like our maintenance window will have to move to a later time/date. We'll let you know more info when it becomes available.

10/13 09:14:13-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, somewhat behind schedule due to an unforeseen issue -- we are now about to carry out some maintenance on the EU hub, this will mean temporary loss of services and a fairly disruptive but brief netsplit. Apologies for the inconvenience, see you on the other side!

10/13 10:28:14-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, while our temporary frexit took slightly longer than anticipated the network should now be starting to normalise, services will be returning momentarily and hopefully it has not caused the pound to plummet any further! Thank you for your patience!

10/14 10:55:51<sirdancealot> ive been on a kind of studying binge
10/14 10:56:06<sirdancealot> key-value stores, for one
10/14 10:56:37<sirdancealot> rdflib docs
10/14 10:57:37<sirdancealot> a week or two back i was on an intel workshop, got a couple nice pointers for further optimization of univar, or just so
10/14 10:57:53<sirdancealot> *cppout
10/14 10:58:03<sirdancealot> i guess
10/14 10:59:49<sirdancealot> ive also been reading up on stuff like java EE and wpf
10/14 11:00:29<sirdancealot> and ofc at work im acquiescing myself with qt
10/14 11:02:17<sirdancealot> im doing everything else than working on newshit
10/14 11:04:41<sirdancealot> but i guess a positive way to look at this is that im acquiring an overview wrt the job market and my options
10/14 11:05:48<sirdancealot> im planning to try their demo http://www.semantacorp.com/
10/14 11:05:53<sirdancealot> i guess youd find BI interesting
10/14 11:06:17<sirdancealot> and sis's bf knows most of the technologies that this sw interfaces with
10/14 11:07:10<sirdancealot> it sounds like at the core this is a linked-data laced wiki, but who knows

10/14 19:28:59<stoopkid> BI's definitely interesting (definitely not as a career though)
10/14 19:30:24<stoopkid> but i'd probably rather do BI / sem-web stuff than this web-dev stuff
10/14 20:22:24<kook_> you practice webdev, i get into java, then we can take on some well paying gigs
10/14 20:33:51<stoopkid> i'm down with that

12/10 21:49:45<dmiles> stoopkid, jinx, for a while now i was thinking eulergui would be ideal
12/10 21:50:15<dmiles> i feel like i need an IDEish thing
12/10 21:51:23<dmiles> in order to organize axiopmns into sets of editoabnle pages
12/10 21:52:42<dmiles> N3 is less a PITA becasue one can breaket entire graphs
12/10 21:53:03<dmiles> N3 is less a PITA becasue one can bracket together entire graphs
12/10 21:55:47<dmiles> i tried to make my own GUI .. its a good menu system but nothing else was great:  https://youtu.be/RIW8eCZ1T7o?t=85
12/10 21:57:00<dmiles> so i think i am going to see how well eurlergui makes for the host application
12/10 22:00:33* dmiles is away for ZzzZzz
12/11 00:41:00<editable-koo>definitely him
12/11 00:53:28<stoopkid> definitely who

01/30 15:03:29<editable-koo>hi
01/30 15:05:32<rszeno> hi
01/30 15:12:24<editable-koo>hows life?
01/30 15:16:26<rszeno> :), like shit.:)
01/30 15:19:25<rszeno> this means, brown and it smell ugly.:)
01/30 15:19:34<editable-koo>why do i always ask..:)
01/30 15:20:21<rszeno> why do I always answer?... :)
01/30 15:22:01<rszeno> ... probably because i have the impression that I know the answer, which is not always the case.:)
01/30 15:24:43<rszeno> sorry, bad phisical shape, paralised partialy, my father died, few month ago, only happy things.:)
01/30 15:26:11<rszeno> actualy life is how you see it, not bad or good, just is as it is.:)
01/30 15:26:12<editable-koo>sorry about that
01/30 15:26:29<editable-koo>not really, you know me..:)
01/30 15:26:46<rszeno> is not your fault, don't need to be sorry.:)
01/30 15:29:22<editable-koo>how do you spend time?
01/30 15:30:50<rszeno> try to work with what is not paralised.:)
01/30 15:32:03<rszeno> i still can hit things when I'm irritated.:)
01/30 15:32:56<rszeno> ...but is too often, unfortunately.:)
01/30 15:33:46* rszeno no completing in chat, I must fix this
01/30 15:34:04<editable-koo>nick?
01/30 15:34:49<rszeno> all, nicks, eng words...
01/30 15:35:31<rszeno> is more easy to write few chars and hit tab.:)
01/30 15:36:22* rszeno probably i need to write a plugin for pidgin
01/30 15:41:36<editable-koo>im stuck on a little problem in newshit
01/30 15:42:01<editable-koo>i think ive been stuck for months now :)
01/30 15:43:13<rszeno> nature?
01/30 15:43:43<rszeno> coding, planing, etc..?
01/30 15:45:06* rszeno i have newshit but is not updated
01/30 15:45:46<editable-koo>design of the objects/classes that implement the core of the language
01/30 15:46:48<editable-koo>classses for atomic kind of nodes, class for compound nodes
01/30 15:47:49<editable-koo>i want to rewrite things so that i can declare a new kind of node from the user side
01/30 15:47:50<rszeno> inheritance, probably first  are nasic
01/30 15:48:45<rszeno> the language have a rewrite ability?
01/30 15:49:14<rszeno> nasic -> basic. typo
01/30 15:49:30<editable-koo>no im redesigning the implementation
01/30 15:51:05<rszeno> kb with  n3, design can be part of kb, and language just use data
01/30 15:51:12<editable-koo>but i did spend some time thinking about adding what i would call a rewriting functionality
01/30 15:51:48<editable-koo>yeah but thats just another can of worms it seems
01/30 15:53:05<editable-koo>or i just havent gotten around to it...
01/30 15:53:06<rszeno> depend, as data struct n3 is simple and implementing a lang for it is almost direct,
01/30 15:53:13<editable-koo>been close tho
01/30 15:54:43<editable-koo>meanwhile, stoopkid here has nothing else on his mind than rewriting everything in agda
01/30 15:56:05<rszeno> is ok, if you like agda.:)
01/30 15:56:25<rszeno> I'm n3 centric
01/30 15:57:18<rszeno> so everything is n3. :)
01/30 15:57:39<editable-koo>thats good
01/30 15:58:33<editable-koo>im coffee centric
01/30 15:59:35<rszeno> is simple, I need only a comvertor from x to n3, description of x and back, everything else is processing n3, infere, cluster, union/join, etc.
01/30 15:59:57<rszeno> query
01/30 16:06:09<stoopkid> actually the only thing i'd like to rewrite in agda is the autonomic code, and that's just because i'd like to have the code in a machine-independent form that we can apply formal verification to
01/30 16:06:46<stoopkid> and i'm still debating with myself whether it's actually worth it
01/30 16:07:22* rszeno I'm adicted to pain. 30 min to write a prog and few days to do same stuff manualy, I'm doing manualy instead to write the program.:)
01/30 16:09:14* rszeno is a proof of being stupid, right? :)
01/30 16:09:56* stoopkid shrugs
01/30 16:10:09<stoopkid> we always say "30 min to write a prog" but it hardly ever turns out to be the case :)
01/30 16:11:44<rszeno> are are only few lines of c
01/30 16:12:58* stoopkid hates writing code outside of polymorphic dependent type theory
01/30 16:14:17<stoopkid> mainly because i hate writing the same things over and over and over again, due to insufficient reusability of code in anything except for polymorphic dependent type theory
01/30 16:14:38<stoopkid> and i hate not being able to apply formal verification to the code i write
01/30 16:15:11<stoopkid> so i often go the "doing stuff manually" route at this point heh
01/30 16:16:34<rszeno> libs, end reuse the code
01/30 16:18:23<stoopkid> libs aren't quite sufficient either, unless they're made fully polymorphic, and even then there's a lot to be asked for
01/30 16:19:24<stoopkid> i'm more interested in databases of code, rather than libs and text files
01/30 16:20:16<stoopkid> or, knowledge-bases, i should say
01/30 16:20:22* editable-koo has to go do the dishes...
01/30 16:21:19<stoopkid> "is simple, I need only a comvertor from x to n3, description of x and back, everything else is processing n3, infere, cluster, union/join, etc."
01/30 16:21:36<stoopkid> this is what i'm after, except n3 + type theory
01/30 16:24:10<rszeno> is - not +,doesn't fit togheter
01/30 16:24:33<stoopkid> sure they do
01/30 16:26:59<stoopkid> n3 is basically like natural deduction, and type theory is given by a set of natural deduction rules, and then all the data-types you define in something like Agda are basically like defining a data-type with natural deduction rules
01/30 16:27:23<stoopkid> data Nat = zero | succ Nat
01/30 16:27:31<stoopkid> data Nat : Set where
01/30 16:27:34<stoopkid>  zero : Nat
01/30 16:27:40<stoopkid> suc : Nat -> Nat
01/30 16:27:41<rszeno> n3 is richer then any language can epresss, so doen't fit
01/30 16:28:41<stoopkid> Nat a Set. zero a Nat. {?x a Nat} => {?x suc ?y. ?y a Nat}
01/30 16:29:24<rszeno> => from what?
01/30 16:29:34<stoopkid> n3
01/30 16:30:19<rszeno> what have n3 with missing a consequence?
01/30 16:30:31<stoopkid> not sure what you mean
01/30 16:32:28<rszeno> {?x suc ?y. ?y a Nat}, doesn't result from previos. n3 doesn't help here
01/30 16:33:59<stoopkid> ?y is an existential
01/30 16:34:19<rszeno> is must implies that is a total function over Nat
01/30 16:34:50<rszeno> suc. I mean
01/30 16:35:13<stoopkid> sure
01/30 16:35:50<stoopkid> i mean, it might/probably will end up being a modified form of n3, but it'll be as close to n3 as possible
01/30 16:35:52<rszeno> yes but this should be a axiom of the formalis,
01/30 16:36:38<rszeno> n3 is just a language, nothing more
01/30 16:37:57<stoopkid> the language will be n3; maybe a restricted/modified form of the n3 lang, but as close as possible
01/30 16:38:26<stoopkid> the inferencing semantics will also be as close as possible to the typical n3 inferencing semantics in stuff like eye
01/30 16:39:02<stoopkid> basically we're only going to diverge from this when it's necessary for the type theory
01/30 16:39:38<rszeno> inference is part of the formalism used not part of n3
01/30 16:40:45<stoopkid> sure
01/30 16:42:02<rszeno> is like using math symbols and their meaning, two parts: a specific syntax and a specific meaning. Both are our choice
01/30 16:42:46<rszeno> n3 only describe what you say using his grammar
01/30 16:42:57<stoopkid> well, syntax as close as possible to n3, semantics as close as possible to eye, basically
01/30 16:43:49<rszeno> well, few eyes are more then two. Is confusing often
01/30 16:45:14<rszeno> i have no doubts about you being correct but I have my understanding related to what I see.:)
01/30 16:45:53<stoopkid> "well, few eyes are more then two. Is confusing often" not sure what you mean
01/30 16:47:45<rszeno> the reason why we talk about this, we have different points of view.:)
01/30 16:48:25<rszeno> i'm not necesarely correct, :)
01/30 16:50:52<stoopkid> i meant eye like euler proof engine, but at this point it's not really a correct vs. incorrect thing, i'm just saying we can mash stuff like this together with type theory
01/30 16:51:16<stoopkid> whether that's a great idea is ofc debatable :)
01/30 16:52:45<rszeno> type theroy is a way to paralise everything, a wrong start
01/30 16:53:38<stoopkid> why do you think so
01/30 16:54:39<rszeno> because i already seen it
01/30 16:55:24<stoopkid> i meant what did you find to be a problem with type theory
01/30 16:57:28<rszeno> the type as concept, it must be more subtile as it is used.
01/30 16:57:56<stoopkid> can you elaborate on that?
01/30 16:59:47<rszeno> what is a kind? we have kind theory? :)
01/30 17:01:12<stoopkid> disregard kinds. they're not a good idea
01/30 17:02:08<stoopkid> the idea of kinds was a bad approach to everything
01/30 17:02:12<stoopkid> same with sorts
01/30 17:02:51<rszeno> both are opinions, more or less documented, kind of shit type,:)
01/30 17:03:39<stoopkid> i agree here: if somebody brings up something like kinds or sorts, it needs to be explained what it is, how it works, and why they're talking about it
01/30 17:03:52<stoopkid> most places i see this used, they really mean something like syntactic categories
01/30 17:04:31<stoopkid> but maybe slightly more general than that. syntactic categories independent of syntax
01/30 17:06:14<stoopkid> they use kinds/sorts to talk about it because they're already talking about a specific syntactic category of "types", so what do they call different syntactic categories? not different "types" of things, but different "kinds"/"sorts" of things
01/30 17:06:27<stoopkid> but i'm pretty sure that just confuses everybody
01/30 17:06:39<stoopkid> and they need a better way to talk about this
01/30 17:08:35<stoopkid> the kinds/sorts terminology was even further abused when they started doing polymorphism and dependent types, because then they had to have functions that quantify over types, and functions that return types
01/30 17:10:08* rszeno on swig, a question about 'singularity'. Shit, IRC is a kind of SF formum, I don't know what type or sort,:)
01/30 17:11:33<stoopkid> anyway, once you disregard all the "kinds" bs, polymorphic dependent type theory with a universe hierarchy == constructive higher-order logic
01/30 17:13:42<rszeno> bs in the end, isn't it? :)
01/30 17:14:14<stoopkid> kinds yes, types no
01/30 17:14:38<stoopkid> well, the word "type" maybe, but not the concept
01/30 17:15:00<rszeno> you can have types and ignore kinds? weird but ...
01/30 17:16:03<stoopkid> sure, kinds are irrelevant
01/30 17:16:37<stoopkid> the concept of types is simply generalizing on the concept of data-types and propositions
01/30 17:17:14<stoopkid> it captures the idea of "traditional" data-types as well as the idea of propositions that have constructive proof
01/30 17:18:21<stoopkid> that's it really
01/30 17:19:01<stoopkid> if you want your propositions to be what you can express in constructive higher-order logic, then your type theory will be polymorphic dependent type theory with a universe hierarchy (one universe for each order)
01/30 17:20:41<stoopkid> simple type theory gets you propositional logic; adding dependent types gets you to (first-order) predicate logic; adding polymorphism with the universe hierarchy gets you higher orders
01/30 17:34:15<stoopkid> there's still a lot to be asked for though.. like, does the logic really need to be constructive
01/30 17:38:24<stoopkid> also: category theory provides a richer framework than type theory for finding models of higher order logic
